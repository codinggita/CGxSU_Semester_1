## How to Use

1. Try solving exercises yourself first
2. Compare your solution with the provided one
3. Run the solution code to see it in action
4. Modify and experiment with the solutions

## Running Solutions

Most solutions can be run directly:

```bash
node solutions/exercise1_database.js
```

Some solutions require setup (database, environment variables, etc.) - check comments in each file.

## Best Practices

Each solution demonstrates:
- Production-ready code
- Error handling
- Input validation
- Security considerations
- Performance optimization
- Clear comments and documentation

## Additional Resources

- MDN Web Docs
- Node.js Documentation
- Express.js Guide
- MongoDB Manual
- PostgreSQL Documentation
