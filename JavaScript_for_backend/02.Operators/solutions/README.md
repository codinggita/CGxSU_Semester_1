### Exercise 4: Logical Expression Evaluator
**File:** `exercise-04-logical-evaluator.js`
**Difficulty:** Medium-Hard
**Topics:** Logical operators, short-circuit evaluation, expression trees

Evaluates complex logical expressions with proper short-circuit behavior and evaluation tracking.

**Run:**
```bash
node exercise-04-logical-evaluator.js
```

---

### Exercise 5: Operator Precedence Quiz Builder
**File:** `exercise-05-precedence-quiz.js`
**Difficulty:** Hard
**Topics:** Operator precedence, associativity, expression evaluation

Generates quiz questions to test understanding of operator precedence and evaluation order.

**Run:**
```bash
node exercise-05-precedence-quiz.js
```

---

### Exercise 6: Feature Flag System
**File:** `exercise-06-feature-flags.js`
**Difficulty:** Hard
**Topics:** Bitwise operators, flags, permissions, role-based access

A production-ready feature flag system using bitwise operators for efficient flag management.

**Run:**
```bash
node exercise-06-feature-flags.js
```

---

## Running All Tests

Each solution file includes its own test suite. To run all tests:

```bash
# Individual tests
node exercise-01-calculator.js
node exercise-02-comparison.js
node exercise-03-smart-defaults.js
node exercise-04-logical-evaluator.js
node exercise-05-precedence-quiz.js
node exercise-06-feature-flags.js

# Or use a test runner (if configured)
npm test
```

## Learning Path

**Recommended order:**
1. **Exercise 1** (Calculator) - Master arithmetic operators
2. **Exercise 2** (Comparison) - Understand equality and comparison
3. **Exercise 3** (Smart Defaults) - Learn modern operators
4. **Exercise 4** (Logical Evaluator) - Deep dive into logical operators
5. **Exercise 5** (Precedence Quiz) - Master operator precedence
6. **Exercise 6** (Feature Flags) - Apply bitwise operators

## Key Concepts Covered

- ✅ All arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, **)
- ✅ Assignment operators and compound assignment
- ✅ Comparison operators (loose vs strict equality)
- ✅ Logical operators and short-circuit evaluation
- ✅ Bitwise operators for flags and permissions
- ✅ Unary operators (++, --, typeof, etc.)
- ✅ Ternary conditional operator
- ✅ Modern operators (optional chaining, nullish coalescing)
- ✅ Operator precedence and associativity
- ✅ Type coercion and conversion

## Additional Challenges

After completing the exercises, try:

1. **Extend Exercise 1:** Add support for scientific notation and complex expressions
2. **Extend Exercise 2:** Implement custom comparison strategies (case-insensitive, fuzzy)
3. **Extend Exercise 3:** Add schema validation for configurations
4. **Extend Exercise 4:** Build a visual expression tree renderer
5. **Extend Exercise 5:** Create an interactive web-based quiz
6. **Extend Exercise 6:** Add feature flag analytics and A/B testing support
