## Overview

Probability and statistics provide the mathematical foundation for modern artificial intelligence and data science. Every major AI technique—from machine learning to deep learning—relies fundamentally on probabilistic reasoning and statistical inference.

**Core principle:** AI systems learn patterns from data using probability to handle uncertainty.

## Key Application Areas

### 1. Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling

**Foundation:** Random variables, expectation, variance

**Applications:**
- **Regression:** Predicting continuous outputs (housing prices, temperatures)
- **Classification:** Predicting categorical outputs (spam/not spam, disease/healthy)
- **Loss functions:** Expected squared error minimization

**Example:** Linear regression minimizes $E[(Y - \hat{Y})^2]$ where $\hat{Y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X$.

### 2. Bayesian Classification

**Foundation:** Bayes' theorem

**Naive Bayes Classifier:**

Given features $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ and class $C$:

$$P(C|X_1,\ldots,X_n) = \frac{P(C) \prod_{i=1}^n P(X_i|C)}{P(X_1,\ldots,X_n)}$$

"Naive" assumption: features are conditionally independent given class.

**Applications:**
- Spam filtering
- Document classification
- Sentiment analysis

**Example:** Spam detection

Given email with words $w_1, \ldots, w_n$:

$$P(\text{spam}|w_1,\ldots,w_n) = \frac{P(\text{spam}) \prod P(w_i|\text{spam})}{P(w_1,\ldots,w_n)}$$

### 3. Statistical Learning Theory

**Foundation:** Probability distributions, expectation

**Key concepts:**
- **Training set:** Sample from unknown distribution
- **Generalization:** Performance on unseen data
- **Bias-variance tradeoff:** Balance between model complexity and overfitting

**Mathematical framework:**

Let $D$ be training data drawn from distribution $P(X,Y)$. Goal: minimize expected loss

$$R(f) = E_{(X,Y)\sim P}[\ell(f(X), Y)]$$

### 4. Random Variables in Neural Networks

**Foundation:** Normal distribution, variance

**Applications:**
- **Weight initialization:** Often $W \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$ for appropriate $\sigma$
- **Dropout:** Randomly drop neurons with probability $p$ (Bernoulli$(p)$)
- **Batch normalization:** Standardize activations to $N(0,1)$

**Stochastic gradient descent:** Uses random mini-batches from training data

### 5. Uncertainty Quantification

**Foundation:** Variance, confidence intervals

**Bayesian deep learning:**
- Model uncertainty through probability distributions over weights
- Predictive distribution: $P(y|x, D) = \int P(y|x,w) P(w|D) \, dw$

**Applications:**
- Medical diagnosis with confidence scores
- Autonomous vehicles (safety-critical decisions)
- Financial risk assessment

### 6. Reinforcement Learning

**Foundation:** Expectation, Markov processes

**Expected return:**

$$V(s) = E\left[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R_t \mid s_0 = s\right]$$

**Policy optimization:** Maximize expected cumulative reward

**Applications:**
- Game playing (AlphaGo, chess)
- Robotics control
- Resource allocation

### 7. Anomaly Detection

**Foundation:** Normal distribution, statistical outliers

**Z-score method:**

$$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

Flag as anomaly if $|z| > \theta$ (e.g., $\theta = 3$)

**Applications:**
- Fraud detection (credit cards)
- Network intrusion detection
- Manufacturing quality control
- Health monitoring

### 8. Natural Language Processing

**Foundation:** Conditional probability, language models

**N-gram language model:**

$$P(w_n|w_1,\ldots,w_{n-1}) \approx P(w_n|w_{n-k+1},\ldots,w_{n-1})$$

**Modern transformers:** Attention mechanisms compute probability distributions over input sequences

**Applications:**
- Machine translation
- Text generation (GPT models)
- Speech recognition

### 9. Recommendation Systems

**Foundation:** Correlation, probability estimation

**Collaborative filtering:**
- Measure similarity between users/items
- Predict ratings using statistical models

**Matrix factorization:** Assume $R \approx UV^T$ where entries are random variables

**Applications:**
- Netflix movie recommendations
- Amazon product suggestions
- Spotify playlist generation

### 10. Computer Vision

**Foundation:** Distributions, Bayes' theorem

**Object detection:**
- Convolutional neural networks output class probabilities
- $P(\text{class}|\text{image region})$ via softmax function

**Generative models:**
- GANs: Learn probability distribution of images
- Variational autoencoders: Probabilistic encoding

**Applications:**
- Face recognition
- Medical image analysis
- Autonomous driving perception

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Spam Classification

**Problem:** Email contains "free" and "money". Given:
- $P(\text{spam}) = 0.3$
- $P(\text{free}|\text{spam}) = 0.6$, $P(\text{money}|\text{spam}) = 0.5$
- $P(\text{free}|\text{ham}) = 0.1$, $P(\text{money}|\text{ham}) = 0.05$

Find $P(\text{spam}|\text{free, money})$

**Solution:**

Assume independence:

$$P(\text{spam}|\text{free, money}) = \frac{P(\text{spam}) \cdot P(\text{free}|\text{spam}) \cdot P(\text{money}|\text{spam})}{P(\text{free, money})}$$

Numerator: $0.3 \times 0.6 \times 0.5 = 0.09$

For ham: $P(\text{ham}) \cdot P(\text{free}|\text{ham}) \cdot P(\text{money}|\text{ham}) = 0.7 \times 0.1 \times 0.05 = 0.0035$

$$P(\text{spam}|\text{free, money}) = \frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.0035} = \frac{0.09}{0.0935} \approx 0.963$$

**Answer:** 96.3% probability spam $\square$

### Example 2: Model Performance

**Problem:** A model predicts disease with 90% accuracy on positive cases and 95% on negative cases. Disease prevalence is 1%. If model predicts positive, what's the probability of disease?

**Solution:**

Let $D$ = disease, $+$ = positive prediction

Given: $P(+|D) = 0.9$, $P(-|D^c) = 0.95$ so $P(+|D^c) = 0.05$, $P(D) = 0.01$

By Bayes:

$$P(D|+) = \frac{P(+|D)P(D)}{P(+|D)P(D) + P(+|D^c)P(D^c)}$$
$$= \frac{0.9 \times 0.01}{0.9 \times 0.01 + 0.05 \times 0.99} = \frac{0.009}{0.009 + 0.0495} = \frac{0.009}{0.0585} \approx 0.154$$

**Answer:** Only 15.4% (low prevalence causes many false positives) $\square$

## Key Takeaways

1. **Uncertainty is fundamental:** AI systems must reason under uncertainty using probability

2. **Bayes' theorem is central:** Enables learning from data and updating beliefs

3. **Distributions model data:** Normal, Bernoulli, Poisson describe real-world phenomena

4. **Expectation guides decisions:** Optimal strategies minimize expected loss

5. **Statistics enable learning:** Sampling, estimation, and inference underpin all ML algorithms

6. **Correlation ≠ causation:** Statistical relationships don't imply causal mechanisms
