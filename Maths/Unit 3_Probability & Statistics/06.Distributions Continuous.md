## The Normal Distribution

### Definition 7.1 (Normal Distribution)

A continuous random variable $X$ has a **normal distribution** with parameters $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\sigma > 0$ if its PDF is:

$$f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}$$

**Notation:** $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$

**Parameters:**
- $\mu$: mean (center of distribution)
- $\sigma^2$: variance (spread of distribution)

### Theorem 7.1 (Properties of Normal Distribution)

If $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$:

1. $E[X] = \mu$
2. $\text{Var}(X) = \sigma^2$
3. The distribution is symmetric about $\mu$
4. Mean = Median = Mode = $\mu$
5. The PDF has inflection points at $\mu \pm \sigma$

### Definition 7.2 (Standard Normal Distribution)

The **standard normal distribution** is $N(0,1)$ with PDF:

$$\phi(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-z^2/2}$$

and CDF:

$$\Phi(z) = P(Z \leq z) = \int_{-\infty}^z \phi(t) \, dt$$

**Notation:** $Z \sim N(0,1)$

### Theorem 7.2 (Standardization)

If $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, then:

$$Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \sim N(0,1)$$

**Proof Sketch:** Use transformation of random variables. The linear transformation shifts by $-\mu$ and scales by $1/\sigma$. $\square$

**Application:** This allows us to convert any normal distribution to standard normal for probability calculations.

### Theorem 7.3 (Empirical Rule / 68-95-99.7 Rule)

For $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$:

1. $P(\mu - \sigma \leq X \leq \mu + \sigma) \approx 0.68$ (68%)
2. $P(\mu - 2\sigma \leq X \leq \mu + 2\sigma) \approx 0.95$ (95%)
3. $P(\mu - 3\sigma \leq X \leq \mu + 3\sigma) \approx 0.997$ (99.7%)

**Interpretation:** Most data falls within a few standard deviations of the mean.

### Theorem 7.4 (Linear Combinations)

If $X \sim N(\mu_X, \sigma_X^2)$ and $Y \sim N(\mu_Y, \sigma_Y^2)$ are independent, then:

$$aX + bY + c \sim N(a\mu_X + b\mu_Y + c, a^2\sigma_X^2 + b^2\sigma_Y^2)$$

**Key insight:** Sums of independent normals are normal.

## Worked Examples

### Example 1 (Simple): Empirical Rule

**Problem:** Heights are normally distributed with $\mu = 170$ cm, $\sigma = 10$ cm. What percentage of heights fall between 160 and 180 cm?

**Solution:**

$X \sim N(170, 100)$

Note that 160 = $\mu - \sigma$ and 180 = $\mu + \sigma$.

By the empirical rule:
$$P(160 \leq X \leq 180) = P(\mu - \sigma \leq X \leq \mu + \sigma) \approx 0.68$$

**Answer:** Approximately 68% $\square$

### Example 2 (Intermediate): Standardization

**Problem:** IQ scores are $N(100, 225)$ (i.e., $\mu = 100$, $\sigma = 15$). Find the probability that a randomly selected person has IQ above 130.

**Solution:**

Standardize:
$$Z = \frac{X - 100}{15}$$

$$P(X > 130) = P\left(\frac{X - 100}{15} > \frac{130 - 100}{15}\right) = P(Z > 2)$$

Using standard normal table: $\Phi(2) \approx 0.9772$

$$P(Z > 2) = 1 - \Phi(2) = 1 - 0.9772 = 0.0228$$

**Answer:** Approximately 2.28% $\square$

---

### Example 3 (Intermediate): Between Two Values

**Problem:** Test scores are $N(70, 100)$. Find $P(60 < X < 80)$.

**Solution:**

Standardize both bounds:
$$P(60 < X < 80) = P\left(\frac{60-70}{10} < Z < \frac{80-70}{10}\right)$$
$$= P(-1 < Z < 1) = \Phi(1) - \Phi(-1)$$

By symmetry: $\Phi(-1) = 1 - \Phi(1)$

Using table: $\Phi(1) \approx 0.8413$

$$P(-1 < Z < 1) = 0.8413 - (1 - 0.8413) = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826$$

**Answer:** Approximately 68.26% (matches empirical rule) $\square$

### Example 4 (Challenging): Finding Percentiles

**Problem:** For $X \sim N(50, 64)$, find the value $x$ such that $P(X \leq x) = 0.90$ (90th percentile).

**Solution:**

We need $\Phi(z) = 0.90$. From z-table: $z \approx 1.28$.

Using standardization:
$$\frac{x - 50}{8} = 1.28$$
$$x = 50 + 8(1.28) = 50 + 10.24 = 60.24$$

**Answer:** The 90th percentile is approximately 60.24 $\square$

### Example 5 (Challenging): Sum of Normals

**Problem:** Let $X \sim N(10, 4)$ and $Y \sim N(15, 9)$ be independent. Find the distribution of $X + Y$ and calculate $P(X + Y > 30)$.

**Solution:**

By Theorem 7.4:
$$X + Y \sim N(10 + 15, 4 + 9) = N(25, 13)$$

Standardize:
$$P(X + Y > 30) = P\left(\frac{(X+Y) - 25}{\sqrt{13}} > \frac{30 - 25}{\sqrt{13}}\right)$$
$$= P\left(Z > \frac{5}{\sqrt{13}}\right) = P(Z > 1.39)$$

Using table: $\Phi(1.39) \approx 0.9177$

$$P(Z > 1.39) = 1 - 0.9177 = 0.0823$$

**Answer:** Approximately 8.23% $\square$

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

For $X \sim N(100, 225)$, find $P(85 \leq X \leq 115)$.

**Hint:** Note that $85 = 100 - 15$ and $115 = 100 + 15$ (i.e., $\mu \pm \sigma$).

**Solution:** By empirical rule, $P(\mu - \sigma \leq X \leq \mu + \sigma) \approx 0.68$ ✓

---

### Exercise 2

If $Z \sim N(0,1)$, find $P(Z < -1.5)$ given $\Phi(1.5) = 0.9332$.

**Hint:** Use symmetry: $\Phi(-z) = 1 - \Phi(z)$.

**Solution:** $P(Z < -1.5) = \Phi(-1.5) = 1 - \Phi(1.5) = 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668$ ✓

---

### Exercise 3

For $X \sim N(20, 16)$, standardize to find $P(X > 24)$.

**Hint:** $Z = \frac{X-20}{4}$, then find $P(Z > 1)$.

**Solution:** $P(X > 24) = P(Z > 1) = 1 - \Phi(1) \approx 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587$ ✓

---

### Exercise 4

Find the 25th percentile of $N(50, 100)$.

**Hint:** Find $z$ where $\Phi(z) = 0.25$; from tables, $z \approx -0.67$.

**Solution:** $x = 50 + 10(-0.67) = 50 - 6.7 = 43.3$ ✓

---

### Exercise 5

If $X \sim N(5, 4)$ and $Y \sim N(10, 9)$ independently, find $E[2X - Y]$ and $\text{Var}(2X - Y)$.

**Hint:** Use linearity of expectation and independence for variance.

**Solution:**
$E[2X - Y] = 2(5) - 10 = 0$
$\text{Var}(2X - Y) = 4(4) + 1(9) = 25$ ✓

## Applications

### Statistics and Hypothesis Testing
The normal distribution is central to statistical inference, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests.

### Quality Control
Process measurements often follow normal distributions; control charts monitor deviations.

### Finance
Asset returns are often modeled as normal (though real data has heavier tails).

### Natural Sciences
Many biological and physical measurements (height, weight, errors) are approximately normal.

### Central Limit Theorem
Sample means of large samples from any distribution approach normality.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Confusing $\sigma$ and $\sigma^2$:** $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ uses variance, not standard deviation, in notation.

2. **Forgetting to standardize:** Always convert to $Z = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$ before using tables.

3. **Sign errors:** $P(Z > z) = 1 - \Phi(z)$, not $\Phi(z)$.

4. **Symmetry misuse:** $\Phi(-z) = 1 - \Phi(z)$ only for standard normal.

## Summary

1. **Normal distribution** $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ has PDF $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/(2\sigma^2)}$

2. **Standardization:** $Z = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$ converts $X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ to $Z \sim N(0,1)$

3. **Empirical rule:** 68% within $\pm 1\sigma$, 95% within $\pm 2\sigma$, 99.7% within $\pm 3\sigma$

4. **Linear combinations:** Sums of independent normals are normal

5. **Universality:** Central Limit Theorem ensures many real-world phenomena are approximately normal
