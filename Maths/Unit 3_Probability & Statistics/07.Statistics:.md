## Measures of Central Tendency

### Definition 8.1 (Sample Mean)

For a dataset $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$, the **sample mean** is:

$$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$

**Interpretation:** The arithmetic average; balancing point of the data.

### Definition 8.2 (Median)

The **median** is the middle value when data is ordered:
- If $n$ odd: median is the $\frac{n+1}{2}$-th value
- If $n$ even: median is average of $\frac{n}{2}$-th and $(\frac{n}{2}+1)$-th values

**Interpretation:** Splits data into two equal halves; robust to outliers.

### Definition 8.3 (Mode)

The **mode** is the most frequently occurring value in the dataset.

**Note:** Data can be unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal.

## Measures of Dispersion

### Definition 8.4 (Sample Variance)

$$s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2$$

**Note:** Division by $n-1$ (not $n$) gives an unbiased estimator of population variance.

### Definition 8.5 (Sample Standard Deviation)

$$s = \sqrt{s^2}$$

**Interpretation:** Average deviation from mean, in original units.

## Correlation and Covariance

### Definition 8.6 (Sample Covariance)

For paired data $\{(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\}$:

$$\text{Cov}(X,Y) = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$$

**Interpretation:**
- Positive: $X$ and $Y$ tend to increase together
- Negative: One increases as other decreases
- Zero: No linear relationship

### Definition 8.7 (Correlation Coefficient)

**Pearson correlation coefficient:**

$$r = \frac{\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{s_X s_Y}$$

where $s_X$ and $s_Y$ are sample standard deviations.

**Properties:**
1. $-1 \leq r \leq 1$
2. $r = 1$: perfect positive linear relationship
3. $r = -1$: perfect negative linear relationship
4. $r = 0$: no linear relationship
5. $r$ is dimensionless

### Theorem 8.1 (Correlation Bounds)

For any dataset: $-1 \leq r \leq 1$

**Proof Sketch:** Use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. $\square$

## Worked Examples

### Example 1 (Simple): Mean, Median, Mode

**Problem:** Find mean, median, and mode for: 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, 7, 7, 9

**Solution:**

**Mean:**
$$\bar{x} = \frac{2+3+3+5+7+7+7+9}{8} = \frac{43}{8} = 5.375$$

**Median:** $n=8$ (even), so median = average of 4th and 5th values = $\frac{5+7}{2} = 6$

**Mode:** 7 (appears 3 times, most frequent)

**Answers:** Mean = 5.375, Median = 6, Mode = 7 $\square$

---

### Example 2 (Intermediate): Variance and Standard Deviation

**Problem:** Calculate sample variance and SD for: 4, 8, 6, 5, 3

**Solution:**

**Mean:** $\bar{x} = \frac{4+8+6+5+3}{5} = \frac{26}{5} = 5.2$

**Deviations:**
$(4-5.2)^2 = 1.44$
$(8-5.2)^2 = 7.84$
$(6-5.2)^2 = 0.64$
$(5-5.2)^2 = 0.04$
$(3-5.2)^2 = 4.84$

**Variance:**
$$s^2 = \frac{1.44+7.84+0.64+0.04+4.84}{4} = \frac{14.8}{4} = 3.7$$

**Standard deviation:** $s = \sqrt{3.7} \approx 1.92$

**Answers:** Variance = 3.7, SD ≈ 1.92 $\square$

### Example 3 (Intermediate): Correlation Calculation

**Problem:** Find correlation between:
$X$: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
$Y$: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10

**Solution:**

**Means:** $\bar{x} = 3$, $\bar{y} = 6$

**Covariance:**
$$\text{Cov}(X,Y) = \frac{(1-3)(2-6) + (2-3)(4-6) + (3-3)(6-6) + (4-3)(8-6) + (5-3)(10-6)}{4}$$
$$= \frac{(-2)(-4) + (-1)(-2) + 0 + (1)(2) + (2)(4)}{4} = \frac{8+2+0+2+8}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5$$

**Standard deviations:**
$$s_X^2 = \frac{(-2)^2+(-1)^2+0^2+1^2+2^2}{4} = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5 \Rightarrow s_X = \sqrt{2.5}$$
$$s_Y^2 = \frac{16+4+0+4+16}{4} = 10 \Rightarrow s_Y = \sqrt{10}$$

**Correlation:**
$$r = \frac{5}{\sqrt{2.5} \cdot \sqrt{10}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{25}} = \frac{5}{5} = 1$$

**Answer:** $r = 1$ (perfect positive correlation) $\square$

### Example 4 (Challenging): Negative Correlation

**Problem:** For data $X$: 1, 2, 3, 4 and $Y$: 8, 6, 4, 2, find $r$ and interpret.

**Solution:**

**Means:** $\bar{x} = 2.5$, $\bar{y} = 5$

**Covariance:**
$$\text{Cov}(X,Y) = \frac{(-1.5)(3) + (-0.5)(1) + (0.5)(-1) + (1.5)(-3)}{3}$$
$$= \frac{-4.5-0.5-0.5-4.5}{3} = \frac{-10}{3}$$

**Variances:** $s_X^2 = \frac{5}{3}$, $s_Y^2 = \frac{20}{3}$

**Correlation:**
$$r = \frac{-10/3}{\sqrt{5/3} \cdot \sqrt{20/3}} = \frac{-10/3}{\sqrt{100/9}} = \frac{-10/3}{10/3} = -1$$

**Interpretation:** Perfect negative correlation; as $X$ increases, $Y$ decreases linearly.

**Answer:** $r = -1$ $\square$

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

---

### Exercise 2

Calculate sample variance for 2, 5, 8, 11.

**Hint:** $\bar{x} = 6.5$

**Solution:** $s^2 = \frac{(2-6.5)^2 + (5-6.5)^2 + (8-6.5)^2 + (11-6.5)^2}{3} = \frac{43.75}{3} \approx 14.58$ ✓

---

### Exercise 4

**Solution:** No linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$ (but nonlinear relationships may still exist) ✓

---

### Exercise 5

Prove that adding a constant to all data values doesn't change the standard deviation.

**Hint:** Show $(x_i + c) - (\bar{x} + c) = x_i - \bar{x}$.

**Solution:** New deviations equal old deviations, so variance (and SD) unchanged ✓

## Applications

### Data Science
Correlation analysis identifies relationships between features in datasets.

### Finance
Correlation measures co-movement of asset returns in portfolio optimization.

### Quality Control
Mean and variance track process stability over time.

### Social Sciences
Statistical summaries describe survey and experimental data.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Confusing correlation and causation:** $r \neq 0$ doesn't imply causation

2. **Outlier sensitivity:** Mean and correlation sensitive to outliers; median and IQR are robust

3. **Zero correlation ≠ independence:** $r=0$ only rules out linear relationships

4. **Sample vs. population:** Use $n-1$ for sample variance (Bessel's correction)

## Summary

1. **Central tendency:** Mean (average), Median (middle), Mode (most frequent)

2. **Dispersion:** Variance $s^2$ and standard deviation $s$ measure spread

3. **Covariance:** Measures joint variability of two variables

4. **Correlation:** Standardized covariance, $-1 \leq r \leq 1$, dimensionless

5. **Interpretation:** $r$ near ±1 indicates strong linear relationship; near 0 indicates weak linear relationship
