## Problems

### Problem 1: Sample Space

**Question:** Toss a coin 3 times. Write the sample space $S$.

**Solution:**

$S = \{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT\}$

where $H$ = heads, $T$ = tails.

$|S| = 2^3 = 8$ outcomes. $\square$

---

### Problem 2: Event Notation

**Question:** Toss two dice. Write the event $A$ = "sum = 9".

**Solution:**

$$A = \{(3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3)\}$$

where ordered pairs represent (first die, second die).

$|A| = 4$ favorable outcomes. $\square$

---

### Problem 3: Binomial Probability

**Question:** A fair coin is tossed 4 times. Find the probability of exactly 3 heads.

**Solution:**

Let $X \sim B(4, 0.5)$ = number of heads.

$$P(X = 3) = \binom{4}{3}(0.5)^3(0.5)^1 = 4 \cdot (0.5)^4 = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}$$

**Answer:** $\frac{1}{4}$ or 25% $\square$

---

### Problem 4: Basic Probability

**Question:** A card is drawn from a 52-card deck. Find $P(\text{Queen})$.

**Solution:**

There are 4 Queens in a standard 52-card deck.

$$P(\text{Queen}) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}$$

**Answer:** $\frac{1}{13}$ $\square$

---

### Problem 5: Classical Probability

**Question:** A bag has 6 red and 4 blue balls. One ball is drawn. Find $P(\text{Red})$.

**Solution:**

Total balls = $6 + 4 = 10$

$$P(\text{Red}) = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$$

**Answer:** $\frac{3}{5}$ or 0.6 $\square$

---

### Problem 6: Event Description

**Question:** A coin is tossed 3 times. Write event $B$ = "at least 2 tails".

**Solution:**

$$B = \{TTT, TTH, THT, HTT\}$$

These are outcomes with 2 or 3 tails.

$|B| = 4$ and $P(B) = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}$ $\square$

---

### Problem 7: Event Probability

**Question:** A die is rolled. Find $P(A)$ where $A$ = {even number}.

**Solution:**

$$A = \{2, 4, 6\}$$

$$P(A) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$$

**Answer:** $\frac{1}{2}$ $\square$

---

### Problem 8: Sample Space and Event

**Question:** A coin is tossed once. Write $S$ and event $C$ = "tail occurs".

**Solution:**

$$S = \{H, T\}$$

$$C = \{T\}$$

$$P(C) = \frac{1}{2}$$

$\square$

---

### Problem 9: Two Dice Probability

**Question:** Two dice are thrown. Find $P(\text{sum} \geq 10)$.

**Solution:**

Sample space: $|S| = 36$

Favorable outcomes where sum $\geq 10$:
- Sum = 10: (4,6), (5,5), (6,4) → 3 outcomes
- Sum = 11: (5,6), (6,5) → 2 outcomes
- Sum = 12: (6,6) → 1 outcome

Total favorable: $3 + 2 + 1 = 6$

$$P(\text{sum} \geq 10) = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$$

**Answer:** $\frac{1}{6}$ $\square$

---

### Problem 10: Event Definition

**Question:** A coin is tossed 3 times. Write event $D$ = "more heads than tails".

**Solution:**

For more heads than tails, need at least 2 heads:

$$D = \{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH\}$$

$|D| = 4$ and $P(D) = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}$ $\square$

---

### Problem 11: Conditional Probability

**Question:** A coin is tossed 3 times. Find $P(\text{at least 2 heads}|\text{first toss is head})$.

**Solution:**

Let $A$ = "at least 2 heads", $B$ = "first toss is head"

Given first toss is H, sample space reduces to:
$$S_B = \{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT\}$$

For at least 2 heads (total), need at least 1 more H in remaining 2 tosses:
$$A \cap B = \{HHH, HHT, HTH\}$$

$$P(A|B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|B|} = \frac{3}{4}$$

**Answer:** $\frac{3}{4}$ $\square$

---

### Problem 12: Independent Events with Replacement

**Question:** Two cards are drawn with replacement. Find $P(\text{Ace on both draws})$.

**Solution:**

With replacement, draws are independent.

$$P(\text{Ace, Ace}) = P(\text{Ace}) \cdot P(\text{Ace}) = \frac{4}{52} \cdot \frac{4}{52} = \frac{16}{2704} = \frac{1}{169}$$

**Answer:** $\frac{1}{169}$ $\square$

---

### Problem 13: Sampling with Replacement

**Question:** A bag has 5 white and 3 black balls. A ball is drawn, replaced, and drawn again. Find $P(\text{both white})$.

**Solution:**

With replacement, draws are independent:

$$P(\text{white, white}) = \frac{5}{8} \cdot \frac{5}{8} = \frac{25}{64}$$

**Answer:** $\frac{25}{64}$ $\square$

---

### Problem 14: Conditional Probability with Dice

**Question:** Two dice are rolled. Let $A$ = "sum = 7" and $B$ = "first die = 5". Find $P(A|B)$.

**Solution:**

Given first die = 5, sample space: $(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6)$

For sum = 7, need second die = 2: only $(5,2)$

$$P(A|B) = \frac{1}{6}$$

**Answer:** $\frac{1}{6}$ $\square$

---

### Problem 15: Independence Test

**Question:** Given $P(M) = 0.6$, $P(P) = 0.5$, $P(M \cap P) = 0.3$. Check whether $M$ and $P$ are independent events.

**Solution:**

For independence, need $P(M \cap P) = P(M) \cdot P(P)$.

Check: $P(M) \cdot P(P) = 0.6 \times 0.5 = 0.3$

Since $P(M \cap P) = 0.3 = P(M) \cdot P(P)$, the events **are independent**. ✓

**Answer:** Yes, $M$ and $P$ are independent. $\square$
