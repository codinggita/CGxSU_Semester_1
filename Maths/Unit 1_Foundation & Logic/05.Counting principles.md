# Counting Principles

## Learning Objectives

- Apply the addition rule to mutually exclusive counting problems
- Apply the multiplication rule to sequential independent choices
- Distinguish between scenarios requiring addition versus multiplication
- Solve multi-step counting problems using combined principles
- Translate real-world scenarios into formal counting structures
- Avoid common overcounting and undercounting errors

## Prerequisites

- Basic arithmetic and algebra
- Understanding of sets and set operations
- Familiarity with logical connectives (AND, OR)

## Definitions and Theoretical Foundations

### Definition 6.1 (Addition Rule - Sum Rule)

If a task can be performed in one of $n_1$ ways **or** in one of $n_2$ ways, where these sets of ways are **mutually exclusive** (disjoint), then the task can be performed in $n_1 + n_2$ ways.

**Generalization:** If a task can be performed in one of $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ mutually exclusive ways, then the total number of ways is:
$$n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_k$$

**Set-Theoretic Formulation:** If $A$ and $B$ are finite disjoint sets ($A \cap B = \emptyset$), then:
$$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|$$

### Definition 6.2 (Multiplication Rule - Product Rule)

If a procedure consists of two successive tasks, where the first can be done in $n_1$ ways and for each of these, the second can be done in $n_2$ ways, then the entire procedure can be done in $n_1 \times n_2$ ways.

**Generalization:** If a procedure consists of $k$ successive independent tasks with $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ ways respectively, then the total number of ways is:
$$n_1 \times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_k$$

**Set-Theoretic Formulation:** For finite sets $A$ and $B$:
$$|A \times B| = |A| \times |B|$$

### Key Distinction

- **Addition Rule (OR):** Mutually exclusive alternatives
- **Multiplication Rule (AND):** Sequential independent choices

## Worked Examples

### Example 1 (Simple): Addition Rule

**Problem:** A student can choose to study mathematics (3 different courses) or physics (4 different courses) as an elective. How many choices does the student have?

**Solution:**

The choices are mutually exclusive—the student selects exactly one course from either mathematics or physics.

Using the **addition rule**:
$$\text{Total choices} = 3 + 4 = 7$$

---

### Example 2 (Simple): Multiplication Rule

**Problem:** A restaurant menu offers 4 appetizers, 5 main courses, and 3 desserts. How many different three-course meals can be ordered?

**Solution:**

The meal consists of three sequential independent choices:
1. Choose appetizer: 4 ways
2. Choose main course: 5 ways
3. Choose dessert: 3 ways

Using the **multiplication rule**:
$$\text{Total meals} = 4 \times 5 \times 3 = 60$$

---

### Example 3 (Intermediate): Combined Rules

**Problem:** A password must consist of 2 letters followed by 3 digits. How many passwords are possible if:
(a) Repetition is allowed
(b) Repetition is not allowed

**Solution:**

**(a) With repetition:**

- First letter: 26 choices
- Second letter: 26 choices (repetition allowed)
- First digit: 10 choices
- Second digit: 10 choices
- Third digit: 10 choices

Using the multiplication rule:
$$26 \times 26 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 26^2 \times 10^3 = 676 \times 1000 = 676,000$$

**(b) Without repetition:**

- First letter: 26 choices
- Second letter: 25 choices (one letter used)
- First digit: 10 choices
- Second digit: 9 choices (one digit used)
- Third digit: 8 choices (two digits used)

Using the multiplication rule:
$$26 \times 25 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 = 468,000$$

---

### Example 4 (Challenging): Complex Scenario

**Problem:** How many 4-digit numbers can be formed using digits 0-9 such that:
- The number does not start with 0
- All digits are distinct

**Solution:**

**Step 1:** First digit (thousands place):
Cannot be 0, so we have 9 choices (1-9).

**Step 2:** Second digit:
Can be any digit except the one used in the first position. Since 0 is now available and one digit is used, we have 9 choices.

**Step 3:** Third digit:
Two digits already used, so 8 choices remain.

**Step 4:** Fourth digit:
Three digits already used, so 7 choices remain.

Using the multiplication rule:
$$9 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 = 4,536$$

### Example 5 (Challenging): License Plates

**Problem:** A license plate consists of 2 letters followed by 4 digits. How many license plates are possible if:
(a) No restrictions
(b) The first letter must be a vowel (A, E, I, O, U)
(c) No letter or digit can be repeated

**Solution:**

**(a) No restrictions:**
$$26 \times 26 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 26^2 \times 10^4 = 6,760,000$$

**(b) First letter is a vowel:**
- First letter: 5 choices (vowels)
- Second letter: 26 choices
- Digits: $10^4$ choices

$$5 \times 26 \times 10^4 = 1,300,000$$

**(c) No repetition:**
- First letter: 26
- Second letter: 25 (one used)
- First digit: 10
- Second digit: 9
- Third digit: 8
- Fourth digit: 7

$$26 \times 25 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 = 3,276,000$$

## Applications and Intuition

### Computer Science: Algorithm Analysis
Counting principles determine:
- Number of possible inputs to an algorithm
- Size of search spaces
- Complexity of brute-force solutions

### Probability Theory
The foundation for calculating probabilities:
$$P(E) = \frac{|E|}{|S|}$$
where $|S|$ is found using counting principles.

### Cryptography
Password strength depends on the size of the keyspace, computed via multiplication rule.

### Combinatorial Optimization
Counting feasible solutions before optimization.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
A person has 5 shirts and 3 pairs of pants. How many different outfits can be formed?

**Hint:** Sequential independent choices.

**Solution:** $5 \times 3 = 15$ outfits

---

### Exercise 2
In a class election, there are 4 candidates for president and 5 candidates for vice president. In how many ways can both positions be filled?

**Hint:** Independent sequential selections.

**Solution:** $4 \times 5 = 20$ ways

---

### Exercise 3
A multiple-choice test has 10 questions, each with 4 possible answers. How many different answer sheets are possible?

**Hint:** Each question is an independent choice.

**Solution:** $4^{10} = 1,048,576$

---

### Exercise 4
How many 3-digit numbers greater than 500 can be formed using digits 0-9 without repetition?

**Hint:** First digit must be 5-9, then handle remaining digits.

**Solution:**
- First digit: 5 choices (5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- Second digit: 9 choices (0-9 except first)
- Third digit: 8 choices

Total: $5 \times 9 \times 8 = 360$

---

### Exercise 5 (Challenge)
A computer password must be 6-8 characters long and contain only lowercase letters. How many passwords are possible?

**Hint:** Add the counts for 6-character, 7-character, and 8-character passwords.

**Solution:**
- 6-character: $26^6$
- 7-character: $26^7$
- 8-character: $26^8$

Total: $26^6 + 26^7 + 26^8 = 26^6(1 + 26 + 26^2) = 26^6 \cdot 703 \approx 217$ billion

## Common Mistakes and Misconceptions

1. **Confusing addition and multiplication:** Use addition for "or" (mutually exclusive), multiplication for "and" (sequential).

2. **Forgetting mutual exclusivity:** Addition rule requires disjoint sets.

3. **Overcounting:** When choices aren't independent, don't simply multiply.

4. **Undercounting:** Missing valid possibilities in complex scenarios.

5. **Zero in leading position:** Remember constraints like "no leading zeros" in numbers.

## Summary and Key Takeaways

1. **Addition Rule:** For mutually exclusive alternatives, add the counts.

2. **Multiplication Rule:** For sequential independent choices, multiply the counts.

3. **Combined problems:** Often require both rules applied systematically.

4. **Order matters:** Sequential choices use multiplication; position constraints require careful analysis.

5. **Repetition:** Allowed repetition increases counts; without repetition, choices decrease sequentially.
