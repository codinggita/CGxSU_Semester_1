## Definitions and Theoretical Foundations

### Definition 5.1 (Principle of Mathematical Induction)

Let $P(n)$ be a predicate defined for integers $n \geq n_0$. To prove $\forall n \geq n_0, P(n)$, it suffices to prove:

1. **Base Case:** $P(n_0)$ is true
2. **Inductive Step:** For all $k \geq n_0$, if $P(k)$ is true, then $P(k+1)$ is true

**Formally:** $$\left[P(n_0) \land \forall k \geq n_0 (P(k) \to P(k+1))\right] \implies \forall n \geq n_0, P(n)$$

**Intuition:** Mathematical induction is analogous to an infinite row of dominoes. If the first domino falls (base case) and each domino knocks over the next (inductive step), then all dominoes fall.

**Logical Foundation:** Induction is equivalent to the **Well-Ordering Principle** of natural numbers: every non-empty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a least element.

### Definition 5.2 (Strong Induction)

To prove $\forall n \geq n_0, P(n)$ using **strong induction**:

1. **Base Case(s):** Prove $P(n_0), P(n_0 + 1), \ldots$ for finitely many initial cases
2. **Inductive Step:** For all $k \geq n_0$, if $P(n_0), P(n_0+1), \ldots, P(k)$ are all true, then $P(k+1)$ is true

**Inductive Hypothesis (Strong Form):** Assume $P(j)$ holds for all $n_0 \leq j \leq k$.

Strong induction is equivalent to ordinary induction but often more natural for certain problems.

### Well-Known Induction Results

**Theorem 5.1 (Sum of First $n$ Natural Numbers):**
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

**Theorem 5.2 (Sum of First $n$ Odd Numbers):**
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i-1) = n^2$$

**Theorem 5.3 (Geometric Series):**
For $r \neq 1$:
$$\sum_{i=0}^{n} r^i = \frac{r^{n+1} - 1}{r - 1}$$

**Theorem 5.4 (Sum of Squares):**
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$$

**Theorem 5.5 (Sum of Cubes):**
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3 = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2$$

## Worked Examples

### Example 1 (Simple): Proving a Summation Formula

**Problem:** Prove that for all $n \geq 1$:
$$1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

**Solution:**

Let $P(n)$ be the statement: $\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$

**Base Case ($n = 1$):**
LHS: $\sum_{i=1}^{1} i = 1$
RHS: $\frac{1(1+1)}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1$
LHS = RHS ✓

**Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume $P(k)$ is true for some arbitrary $k \geq 1$:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{k} i = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$$

**Inductive Step:** Prove $P(k+1)$:
$$\begin{align}
\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i &= \left(\sum_{i=1}^{k} i\right) + (k+1)\\
&= \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) \quad \text{(by inductive hypothesis)}\\
&= \frac{k(k+1) + 2(k+1)}{2}\\
&= \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}\\
&= \frac{(k+1)((k+1)+1)}{2}
\end{align}$$

This is exactly $P(k+1)$. ✓

**Conclusion:** By the principle of mathematical induction, $P(n)$ holds for all $n \geq 1$. $\square$

---

### Example 2 (Intermediate): Proving an Inequality

**Problem:** Prove that for all $n \geq 1$: $2^n > n$.

**Solution:**

Let $P(n)$ be the statement: $2^n > n$

**Base Case ($n = 1$):**
$2^1 = 2 > 1$ ✓

**Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume $2^k > k$ for some $k \geq 1$.

**Inductive Step:** Prove $2^{k+1} > k+1$:
$$\begin{align}
2^{k+1} &= 2 \cdot 2^k\\
&> 2 \cdot k \quad \text{(by inductive hypothesis)}\\
&= k + k\\
&\geq k + 1 \quad \text{(since } k \geq 1 \text{)}
\end{align}$$

Actually, we need strict inequality. Since $k \geq 1$, we have $k \geq 1$, so $k + k \geq k + 1$ with equality only when $k = 1$. But for $k = 1$: $2 \cdot 1 = 2 > 1 + 1 = 2$ is false.

Let me reconsider. For $k \geq 1$:
- If $k = 1$: $2^{k+1} = 2^2 = 4 > 2 = k + 1$ ✓
- If $k \geq 2$: $2 \cdot k \geq 2 \cdot 2 = 4 > k + 1$ (since $k + 1 \leq 3$ for $k = 2$, and $4 > 3$)

More rigorously: $2k - (k+1) = k - 1 \geq 0$ when $k \geq 1$, with strict inequality when $k > 1$, and equality at $k = 1$ gives $2 \cdot 1 = 2 = 1 + 1$, but we showed the base case $k=1$ directly.

Actually, the cleanest approach: Since $2^k > k$ and $k \geq 1$, we have:
$$2^{k+1} = 2 \cdot 2^k > 2k = k + k \geq k + 1$$

**Conclusion:** By mathematical induction, $2^n > n$ for all $n \geq 1$. $\square$

### Example 3 (Challenging): Strong Induction

**Problem:** Every integer $n \geq 2$ can be expressed as a product of prime numbers.

**Solution:**

Let $P(n)$ be: "$n$ can be expressed as a product of primes."

**Base Case ($n = 2$):**
$2$ is prime, so $2 = 2$ is a product of primes (trivially). ✓

**Inductive Hypothesis (Strong Form):** Assume $P(j)$ holds for all $2 \leq j \leq k$ for some $k \geq 2$.

**Inductive Step:** Prove $P(k+1)$:

**Case 1:** If $k+1$ is prime, then $k+1$ is trivially a product of primes (itself). ✓

**Case 2:** If $k+1$ is composite, then $k+1 = ab$ for some integers $a, b$ with $2 \leq a, b \leq k$.

By the inductive hypothesis (strong form), both $a$ and $b$ can be expressed as products of primes:
- $a = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r$
- $b = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_s$

Therefore:
$$k+1 = ab = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_r q_1 q_2 \cdots q_s$$

which is a product of primes. ✓

**Conclusion:** By strong induction, every integer $n \geq 2$ is a product of primes. $\square$

### Example 4 (Advanced): Recursive Algorithm Verification

**Problem:** Verify that the recursive algorithm for computing $n!$ is correct:

```
factorial(n):
    if n == 0: return 1
    else: return n * factorial(n-1)
```

**Solution:**

Let $P(n)$ be: "factorial($n$) correctly computes $n!$"

**Base Case ($n = 0$):**
factorial(0) returns 1, and $0! = 1$ by definition. ✓

**Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume factorial($k$) correctly computes $k!$ for some $k \geq 0$.

**Inductive Step:** Prove factorial($k+1$) correctly computes $(k+1)!$:

By the algorithm:
$$\text{factorial}(k+1) = (k+1) \cdot \text{factorial}(k)$$

By the inductive hypothesis, factorial($k$) = $k!$, so:
$$\text{factorial}(k+1) = (k+1) \cdot k! = (k+1)!$$

which is correct. ✓

**Conclusion:** The recursive factorial algorithm is correct for all $n \geq 0$. $\square$

## Applications and Intuition

### Algorithm Correctness
Induction verifies recursive algorithms by showing:
1. Base case(s) handle termination correctly
2. Recursive step preserves correctness

### Loop Invariants
For iterative algorithms, loop invariants (properties true before/after each iteration) are proven by induction.

### Combinatorial Identities
Many binomial and combinatorial formulas are proven via induction.

### Recurrence Relations
Solutions to recurrence relations (e.g., Fibonacci) are verified by induction.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
Prove by induction: $\sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i-1) = n^2$ for all $n \geq 1$.

**Hint:** Base case $n=1$ gives $1 = 1^2$. For inductive step, add the $(k+1)$-th odd number.

**Solution:** [Work through base case, inductive hypothesis, and step as shown in examples]

---

### Exercise 2
Prove: $3 \mid (n^3 - n)$ for all $n \geq 1$.

**Hint:** Show $(k+1)^3 - (k+1) = k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1 - k - 1 = (k^3 - k) + 3k^2 + 3k$.

**Solution:** Since $3 \mid (k^3 - k)$ by hypothesis and $3 \mid (3k^2 + 3k)$ obviously, $3 \mid (k+1)^3 - (k+1)$.

---

### Exercise 3
Prove: $\sum_{i=0}^{n} 2^i = 2^{n+1} - 1$ for $n \geq 0$.

**Hint:** Geometric series with $r = 2$.

**Solution:** Base: $2^0 = 1 = 2^1 - 1$. Step: $\sum_{i=0}^{k+1} 2^i = (2^{k+1}-1) + 2^{k+1} = 2 \cdot 2^{k+1} - 1 = 2^{k+2} - 1$. ✓

---

### Exercise 4
Prove: $n! > 2^n$ for all $n \geq 4$.

**Hint:** Base case $n=4$: $24 > 16$ ✓. Step: $(k+1)! = (k+1) \cdot k! > (k+1) \cdot 2^k$. Show $(k+1) \cdot 2^k > 2^{k+1}$ for $k \geq 4$.

**Solution:** Need $k+1 > 2$, which holds for $k \geq 4$. Thus $(k+1)! > 2^{k+1}$. ✓

---

### Exercise 5 (Challenge)
Prove the Binomial Theorem using induction: $(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k$ for $n \geq 0$.

**Hint:** Use Pascal's identity: $\binom{n+1}{k} = \binom{n}{k-1} + \binom{n}{k}$.

**Solution:** [Detailed proof requires careful expansion and regrouping]

## Common Mistakes and Misconceptions

1. **Skipping the base case:** Induction fails without verifying the initial case.

2. **Assuming what needs to be proven:** Don't assume $P(k+1)$; derive it from $P(k)$.

3. **Incorrect inductive hypothesis:** Clearly state what you're assuming.

4. **Circular reasoning:** Ensure the inductive step uses only $P(k)$, not $P(k+1)$.

5. **Wrong base case:** Start where the claim is actually true (e.g., $n \geq 4$ for $n! > 2^n$).

## Summary and Key Takeaways

1. **Mathematical induction** proves statements for all $n \geq n_0$ by verifying a base case and an inductive step.

2. **Strong induction** assumes all previous cases $P(n_0), \ldots, P(k)$ to prove $P(k+1)$.

3. **Inductive hypothesis** is the assumption $P(k)$ (or all previous cases in strong induction).

4. **Verification** requires both base case and inductive step; omitting either invalidates the proof.

5. **Applications** include algorithm verification, combinatorial identities, divisibility, and inequalities.
