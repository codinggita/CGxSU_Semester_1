## Overview

This assignment focuses on subgraphs, induced subgraphs, spanning subgraphs, and connected components. These concepts are fundamental for understanding graph structure and decomposition.

## Problems

### Problem 1: Subgraph Construction

Consider the graph $G$:

```
   A — B — C
   |     /
   D — E
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Draw a subgraph $H$ by removing vertices $\{C, E\}$
(b) Write $V(H)$ and $E(H)$

**Solution:**

(a) **Subgraph $H$:**

Removing vertices $C$ and $E$ also removes all edges incident to them.

Resulting subgraph:
```
   A — B
   |
   D
```

(b) **Sets:**

$$V(H) = \{A, B, D\}$$

$$E(H) = \{\{A,B\}, \{A,D\}\}$$

Note: Edge $\{B,C\}$ is removed (incident to $C$), edges $\{B,E\}$ and $\{D,E\}$ are removed (incident to $E$). $\square$

### Problem 2: Connected Components

Given the graph:

```
P --- Q      R --- S
```

**Tasks:**
(a) How many connected components are present?
(b) Write the vertices in each component

**Solution:**

(a) **Number of components:**

The graph has **2 connected components**.

(b) **Components:**

- Component 1: $\{P, Q\}$
- Component 2: $\{R, S\}$

Each component is internally connected but there are no edges between components. $\square$

---

### Problem 3: Connectivity Check

Given the graph:

```
1 — 2 — 3      4 — 5
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Is the graph connected or disconnected?
(b) If disconnected, write the number of components

**Solution:**

(a) **Connectivity:**

The graph is **disconnected** because there is no path from vertices $\{1,2,3\}$ to vertices $\{4,5\}$.

(b) **Number of components:**

**2 components:**
- Component 1: $\{1, 2, 3\}$
- Component 2: $\{4, 5\}$ $\square$

---

### Problem 4: Subgraph Examples

Given the graph:

```
P — Q — R — S
```

**Task:** Find two different subgraphs and write their vertices and edges

**Solution:**

**Subgraph 1:**
- $V(H_1) = \{P, Q, R\}$
- $E(H_1) = \{\{P,Q\}, \{Q,R\}\}$

**Subgraph 2:**
- $V(H_2) = \{Q, R, S\}$
- $E(H_2) = \{\{Q,R\}, \{R,S\}\}$

Both are valid subgraphs of $G$. Many other subgraphs exist. $\square$

---

### Problem 5: Connected Components in Set Notation

Given the graph:

```
A      B — C — D
```

**Task:** Write all connected components in set notation

**Solution:**

**Connected components:**

$$C_1 = \{A\}$$

$$C_2 = \{B, C, D\}$$

Vertex $A$ is isolated (no edges), forming its own component. $\square$

---

### Problem 6: Draw and Identify

Given edge set: $E = \{(A,B), (B,C), (C,A), (D,E)\}$

**Tasks:**
(a) Draw the graph $G$
(b) Count the connected components

**Solution:**

(a) **Graph drawing:**

```
    A
   / \
  B — C

  D — E
```

(b) **Connected components:**

**Number of components: 2**

- Component 1: Triangle $\{A, B, C\}$
- Component 2: Edge $\{D, E\}$ $\square$

---

### Problem 7: Proper Subgraph

Given the graph:

```
X — Y — Z — W
```

**Task:** Draw a proper subgraph by removing at least one vertex and one edge

**Solution:**

**Proper subgraph $H$:**

Remove vertex $W$ and edge $\{Y,Z\}$:

```
X — Y     Z
```

**Vertex set:** $V(H) = \{X, Y, Z\}$

**Edge set:** $E(H) = \{\{X,Y\}\}$

This is a proper subgraph because $V(H) \subset V(G)$ and $E(H) \subset E(G)$. $\square$

---

### Problem 8: Subgraph Validation

**Original Graph:**
- Vertices = $\{1,2,3,4\}$
- Edges = $\{(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)\}$

**Proposed Subgraph:**
- Vertices = $\{1,2,3\}$
- Edges = $\{(1,2), (1,3)\}$

**Task:** Is this a valid subgraph? Provide justification.

**Solution:**

**Analysis:**

For $H$ to be a subgraph of $G$:
1. $V(H) \subseteq V(G)$: ✓ ($\{1,2,3\} \subseteq \{1,2,3,4\}$)
2. $E(H) \subseteq E(G)$: Check each edge
   - $(1,2) \in E(G)$: ✓
   - $(1,3) \in E(G)$: ✗ **NOT in original graph**

**Conclusion:** This is **not a valid subgraph** because edge $(1,3)$ does not exist in the original graph.

A valid subgraph with vertices $\{1,2,3\}$ would have edges from $\{\{1,2\}, \{2,3\}\}$ only. $\square$

---

### Problem 9: Connected Components Count

Given the graph:

```
  A — B     C — D — E     F
```

**Task:** Find the number of connected components with reasoning

**Solution:**

**Analysis:**

- Component 1: $\{A, B\}$ (connected by edge $\{A,B\}$)
- Component 2: $\{C, D, E\}$ (connected: $C-D-E$ path exists)
- Component 3: $\{F\}$ (isolated vertex)

**Number of components: 3**

**Reasoning:** Each component is maximal (cannot add more vertices while maintaining connectivity), and no paths exist between different components. $\square$

### Problem 10: Subgraphs with 2 Vertices

Given the graph:

```
M — N — O
```

**Task:** Draw all possible subgraphs containing exactly 2 vertices

**Solution:**

**Subgraph 1:** $V = \{M, N\}$, $E = \{\{M,N\}\}$
```
M — N
```

**Subgraph 2:** $V = \{N, O\}$, $E = \{\{N,O\}\}$
```
N — O
```

**Subgraph 3:** $V = \{M, O\}$, $E = \emptyset$
```
M     O
```

These are all possible 2-vertex subgraphs. $\square$

---

### Problem 11: Connecting Graph Components

**Question:** A graph has three connected components. Is it possible to add exactly two edges to make the entire graph connected? Explain with a figure.

**Solution:**

**Yes, it is possible.**

**Proof by example:**

Original graph with 3 components:
```
A — B     C — D     E — F
```

Add edges $\{B,C\}$ and $\{D,E\}$:
```
A — B — C — D — E — F
```

**Result:** Single connected component.

**General principle:** To connect $k$ components into one, we need at least $k-1$ edges (forming a spanning tree structure on the components). For $k=3$, we need at least 2 edges. ✓ $\square$

---

### Problem 12: Connectivity in Induced Subgraph

Given the graph:

```
P — Q — R — S — T
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Draw the induced subgraph on vertices $\{P, Q, S\}$
(b) State whether it is connected or disconnected

**Solution:**

(a) **Induced subgraph $G[\{P,Q,S\}]$:**

An induced subgraph includes all edges from $G$ whose endpoints are both in the vertex subset.

Edges in $G$: $\{P,Q\}, \{Q,R\}, \{R,S\}, \{S,T\}$

Edges with both endpoints in $\{P,Q,S\}$: Only $\{P,Q\}$

```
P — Q     S
```

(b) **Connectivity:**

The induced subgraph is **disconnected** because there is no path from $S$ to $P$ or $Q$ within the subgraph. $\square$

---

### Problem 13: Components in Set Form

Given the graph:

```
1 — 2     3      4 — 5 — 6
```

**Task:** List all connected components in set form

**Solution:**

**Connected components:**

$$C_1 = \{1, 2\}$$

$$C_2 = \{3\}$$

$$C_3 = \{4, 5, 6\}$$

Total: 3 components. $\square$

---

### Problem 14: Conceptual Question on Trees

**Question:** Can a tree be disconnected? Justify your answer using an example.

**Solution:**

**No, a tree cannot be disconnected.**

**Justification:**

By definition, a **tree** is a connected acyclic graph. Connectivity is a defining property of trees.

If a graph is disconnected, it is called a **forest**, not a tree. Each connected component of a forest is itself a tree.

**Example of a forest (not a tree):**
```
A — B     C — D
```

This has 2 trees (components), so it's a forest, not a tree. $\square$

---

### Problem 15: Subgraph and Components

Given the graph:

```
U — V — W      X — Y
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Count connected components
(b) Draw a subgraph containing only the first component
(c) Write its vertices and edges

**Solution:**

(a) **Number of components:**

**2 components:**
- $C_1 = \{U, V, W\}$
- $C_2 = \{X, Y\}$

(b) **Subgraph of first component:**

```
U — V — W
```

(c) **Subgraph specification:**

$$V(H) = \{U, V, W\}$$

$$E(H) = \{\{U,V\}, \{V,W\}\}$$

This subgraph is identical to the first connected component. $\square$
