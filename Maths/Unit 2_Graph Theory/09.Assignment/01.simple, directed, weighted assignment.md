## Problems

### Problem 1: Simple Graph Identification

Given the graph:

```
A ----- B
|       |
|       |
D ----- C
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Identify the type of graph
(b) Write $V(G)$ and $E(G)$
(c) Find the degree of each vertex

**Solution:**

(a) **Graph type:**

This is a **simple undirected graph** because:
- No self-loops (no edge from a vertex to itself)
- No multiple edges between the same pair of vertices
- Edges are bidirectional (undirected)

(b) **Vertex and edge sets:**

$$V(G) = \{A, B, C, D\}$$

$$E(G) = \{\{A,B\}, \{A,D\}, \{B,C\}, \{C,D\}\}$$

(c) **Degrees:**
- $\deg(A) = 2$ (edges to $B, D$)
- $\deg(B) = 2$ (edges to $A, C$)
- $\deg(C) = 2$ (edges to $B, D$)
- $\deg(D) = 2$ (edges to $A, C$)

This is a **2-regular graph** (all vertices have the same degree). $\square$

---

### Problem 2: Directed Graph Degrees

Given the directed graph:

```
A → B → C
↑     ↓
D ← E
```

**Tasks:**
(a) List all directed edges
(b) Find in-degree and out-degree of vertex $C$

**Solution:**

(a) **Directed edge set:**

$$A = \{(A,B), (B,C), (B,E), (E,D), (D,A)\}$$

where $(u,v)$ denotes a directed edge from $u$ to $v$.

(b) **Degrees of $C$:**

**In-degree of $C$:** Number of edges entering $C$
- Edge $(B,C)$ enters $C$
- $\deg^{in}(C) = 1$

**Out-degree of $C$:** Number of edges leaving $C$
- No edges leave $C$
- $\deg^{out}(C) = 0$

**Answer:** $\deg^{in}(C) = 1$, $\deg^{out}(C) = 0$ $\square$

### Problem 3: Weighted Path

Given the weighted graph:

```
A --2-- B --3-- C
|               |
4               6
|               |
D -----5------ E
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Identify the type of graph
(b) Find the total weight of the path $A \to B \to C \to E$

**Solution:**

(a) **Graph type:**

This is a **weighted undirected graph** where each edge has an associated numerical weight.

(b) **Path weight:**

Path: $A \to B \to C \to E$

Edges and weights:
- $\{A,B\}$: weight = 2
- $\{B,C\}$: weight = 3
- $\{C,E\}$: weight = 6

**Total weight:**
$$w(A \to B \to C \to E) = 2 + 3 + 6 = 11$$

**Answer: 11** $\square$

### Problem 4: Cycle in Simple Graph

Given the graph:

```
P --- Q
|   / |
|  /  |
R --- S
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Determine if a cycle exists
(b) Write one cycle using proper notation

**Solution:**

(a) **Cycle existence:**

Yes, the graph contains multiple cycles.

(b) **One cycle:**

Following the vertices: $P \to Q \to S \to R \to P$

**Cycle notation:** $(P, Q, S, R, P)$ with length 4. $\square$

---

### Problem 5: Directed Path Validity

Given the directed graph:

```
1 → 2 → 3
↑     ↓
4 ← 5
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Write the list of directed edges
(b) Check if the path $4 \to 1 \to 2 \to 3 \to 5$ is valid

**Solution:**

(a) **Directed edges:**

$$A = \{(1,2), (2,3), (2,5), (5,4), (4,1)\}$$

(b) **Path validation:**

For path $4 \to 1 \to 2 \to 3 \to 5$ to be valid, we need:
- $(4,1)$: ✓ exists
- $(1,2)$: ✓ exists
- $(2,3)$: ✓ exists
- $(3,5)$: ✗ **does not exist** (only $(2,5)$ exists, not $(3,5)$)

**The path is invalid** because edge $(3,5)$ does not exist.

A valid path from $4$ to $5$ would be: $4 \to 1 \to 2 \to 5$ $\square$

---

### Problem 6: Shortest Path in Weighted Graph

Given the weighted graph:

```
M --8-- N
|      /
2     / 7
|   /
O --5-- P
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Write the weights of edges incident on $O$
(b) Find the shortest path from $M$ to $P$

**Solution:**

(a) **Edges incident on $O$:**

- $\{M,O\}$: weight = 2
- $\{O,P\}$: weight = 5

**Weights: 2 and 5** ✓

(b) **Shortest path from $M$ to $P$:**

Possible paths:
1. $M \to N \to P$: weight = $8 + 7 = 15$
2. $M \to O \to P$: weight = $2 + 5 = 7$

**Shortest path:** $M \to O \to P$ with total weight **7** $\square$

### Problem 7: Graph Type Classification

Given the graph:

```
U ⇄ V
|     \
|      \
W ----> X
```

**Task:** Identify the type of graph (Directed / Undirected / Mixed)

**Solution:**

**Graph type: Mixed graph**

Explanation:
- Edge $\{U,V\}$ with arrows in both directions could represent:
  - Two directed edges: $(U,V)$ and $(V,U)$, or
  - One undirected edge
- Edge $(U,W)$: appears undirected
- Edge $(V,X)$: appears directed
- Edge $(W,X)$: directed

This graph contains both directed and undirected edges, making it a **mixed graph**. $\square$

---

### Problem 8: Degree Analysis

Given the graph:

```
L --- M --- N
 \         /
   \     /
      O
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Find the degree of all vertices
(b) Determine if the graph is simple

**Solution:**

(a) **Degrees:**
- $\deg(L) = 2$ (edges to $M, O$)
- $\deg(M) = 2$ (edges to $L, N$)
- $\deg(N) = 2$ (edges to $M, O$)
- $\deg(O) = 2$ (edges to $L, N$)

(b) **Is the graph simple?**

**Yes**, the graph is simple because:
- No self-loops
- No multiple edges between the same vertices
- Each vertex pair has at most one edge

This forms a cycle graph $C_4$. $\square$

---

### Problem 9: Directed Degree Analysis

Given the directed graph:

```
A → B → D
↓     ↑
C ----
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Find in-degree and out-degree of all vertices
(b) Check whether any directed cycle is present

**Solution:**

(a) **Degree table:**

| Vertex | In-degree | Out-degree | Total degree |
|--------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| A      | 0         | 2          | 2            |
| B      | 1         | 1          | 2            |
| C      | 1         | 1          | 2            |
| D      | 2         | 0          | 2            |

(b) **Directed cycle:**

Following directed edges: $A \to B \to D$... no path back to $A$ from $D$.

Try: $A \to C \to B \to D$... still no return to $A$.

Checking all paths: **No directed cycle exists** in this graph. $\square$

---

### Problem 10: Weighted Cycle

Given the weighted graph:

```
X --4-- Y
|       |
9       6
|       |
Z --3-- W
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Write the weight of the cycle $X \to Y \to W \to Z \to X$
(b) Check if the graph is complete

**Solution:**

(a) **Cycle weight:**

Edges in cycle:
- $\{X,Y\}$: weight = 4
- $\{Y,W\}$: weight = 6
- $\{W,Z\}$: weight = 3
- $\{Z,X\}$: weight = 9

**Total weight:** $4 + 6 + 3 + 9 = 22$ ✓

(b) **Completeness:**

For a complete graph on 4 vertices, we need $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ edges.

Current edges: 4 (only the cycle edges)

Missing edges: $\{X,W\}$ and $\{Y,Z\}$

**The graph is not complete.** $\square$

---

### Problem 11: Strong Connectivity

Given the directed graph:

```
S → T → U
↑     ↓
R ← ← V
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Find vertices having out-degree $\geq 2$
(b) Check if the graph is strongly connected

**Solution:**

(a) **Out-degrees:**
- $\deg^{out}(S) = 1$ (edge to $T$)
- $\deg^{out}(T) = 2$ (edges to $U, V$)
- $\deg^{out}(U) = 0$
- $\deg^{out}(V) = 2$ (edges to $R, U$... wait, checking diagram)

Actually, from the diagram:
- $S \to T$
- $T \to U$
- $T \to V$ (down arrow)
- $V \to R$

Recounting:
- $\deg^{out}(T) = 2$ ✓

**Vertices with out-degree $\geq 2$: $\{T\}$**

(b) **Strong connectivity:**

A directed graph is strongly connected if there exists a directed path from every vertex to every other vertex.

Check if we can reach $S$ from $U$: No outgoing edges from $U$.

**The graph is not strongly connected.** $\square$

### Problem 12: Shortest Weighted Path

Given the weighted graph:

```
1 --10-- 2 --1-- 3
|               |
4              2
|               |
5 -----8------ 4
```

**Task:** Find the shortest path from $1$ to $3$ with its weight

**Solution:**

**Possible paths:**

1. $1 \to 2 \to 3$: weight = $10 + 1 = 11$
2. $1 \to 5 \to 4 \to 3$: weight = $4 + 8 + 2 = 14$

**Shortest path:** $1 \to 2 \to 3$ with weight **11** $\square$

---

### Problem 13: Mixed Graph Analysis

Given the graph:

```
B --3-- C
↑       ↓
A       D
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Identify the graph type
(b) Count weighted edges

**Solution:**

(a) **Graph type:**

The graph has:
- Weighted undirected edge: $\{B,C\}$ with weight 3
- Directed edges: $(A,B)$ and $(C,D)$

**Type: Mixed weighted graph** (contains both directed and weighted undirected edges)

(b) **Weighted edges:**

Only edge $\{B,C\}$ has an explicit weight of 3.

**Count: 1 weighted edge** $\square$

---

### Problem 14: Planarity Check

Given the graph:

```
H --- I
| \   |
|  \  |
J --- K
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Write the edge set
(b) Check if the graph is planar

**Solution:**

(a) **Edge set:**
$$E = \{\{H,I\}, \{H,J\}, \{H,K\}, \{I,K\}, \{J,K\}\}$$

(b) **Planarity:**

A graph is planar if it can be drawn in the plane without edge crossings.

This graph is $K_4$ (complete graph on 4 vertices) minus one edge.

$K_4$ is planar, and removing an edge maintains planarity.

**The graph is planar.** ✓ $\square$

---

### Problem 15: Weighted Path Comparison

Given the weighted graph:

```
P --4-- Q --7-- R
|       \
2        \ 3
|         \
S ----6---- T
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Find the cost of paths: (i) $P \to Q \to R$ (ii) $P \to S \to T \to R$
(b) Which path is shorter?

**Solution:**

(a) **Path costs:**

(i) $P \to Q \to R$:
- Edges: $\{P,Q\}$ (weight 4), $\{Q,R\}$ (weight 7)
- **Cost: $4 + 7 = 11$**

(ii) $P \to S \to T \to R$:
- Wait, we need edge $\{T,R\}$ to exist. From the diagram, we have:
  - $\{P,S\}$: weight 2
  - $\{S,T\}$: weight 6
  - $\{Q,T\}$: weight 3

But there's no direct edge from $T$ to $R$. Let me reconsider the path.

Alternative interpretation: $P \to S \to T \to Q \to R$
- Cost: $2 + 6 + 3 + 7 = 18$

Or perhaps: $P \to Q \to T$ then $T \to ?$

Given the diagram shows $\{Q,T\}$ with weight 3, let's assume path (ii) should go through available edges.

If no $\{T,R\}$ exists, the path $P \to S \to T \to R$ is **invalid**.

(b) **Comparison:**

Given only valid paths, **path (i) $P \to Q \to R$ with cost 11** is the accessible path. $\square$
