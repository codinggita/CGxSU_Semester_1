## Problems

### Problem 1: Tree Definition and Properties

**Tasks:**
(a) Define a **tree** in graph theory
(b) Draw a tree with 6 vertices having 2 levels below the root
(c) Label the root, leaf nodes, and state the height

**Solution:**

(a) **Definition:**

A **tree** is a connected acyclic graph. Equivalently, a tree with $n$ vertices has exactly $n-1$ edges, and there exists exactly one path between any pair of vertices.

(b) **Tree diagram:**

```
       A (root)
      / \
     B   C
    /|   |\
   D E   F
```

(c) **Properties:**
- **Root:** $A$ (level 0)
- **Leaf nodes:** $\{D, E, F\}$ (vertices with no children)
- **Height:** 2 (longest path from root to any leaf: $A \to B \to D$) $\square$

### Problem 2: Binary Tree Components

Given the binary tree:

```
     A
   /   \
  B     C
 / \
D   E
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Parent of $D$
(b) Children of $B$
(c) Leaf nodes

**Solution:**

(a) **Parent of $D$:** $B$ ✓

(b) **Children of $B$:** $\{D, E\}$ ✓

(c) **Leaf nodes:** $\{D, E, C\}$ (vertices with no children) $\square$

---

### Problem 3: Full Binary Tree Verification

Consider the tree:

```
     R
   /   \
  S     T
       / \
      U   V
```

**Task:** Determine whether this is a full binary tree. Justify your answer.

**Solution:**

**Definition:** A **full binary tree** (proper binary tree) is one where every internal node has exactly 2 children.

**Analysis:**
- Root $R$: has 2 children ($S, T$) ✓
- Node $S$: has 0 children (leaf) ✓
- Node $T$: has 2 children ($U, V$) ✓
- Nodes $U, V$: leaves ✓

All internal nodes ($R, T$) have exactly 2 children.

**Conclusion:** Yes, this is a **full binary tree**. $\square$

---

### Problem 4: Constructing a Full Binary Tree

**Task:** Draw a full binary tree with exactly 7 nodes. State the formula used.

**Solution:**

**Formula:** For a binary tree of height $h$:
$$\text{Maximum nodes} = 2^{h+1} - 1$$

For 7 nodes: $2^{h+1} - 1 = 7 \Rightarrow 2^{h+1} = 8 \Rightarrow h = 2$

**Full binary tree with 7 nodes:**

```
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   / \   / \
  4   5 6   7
```

All levels are completely filled, and all internal nodes have exactly 2 children. $\square$

---

### Problem 5: Complete Binary Tree Verification

Given the tree:

```
     A
   /   \
  B     C
 / \
D   E
```

**Task:** Check if this is a complete binary tree. Provide clear reasoning.

**Solution:**

**Definition:** A **complete binary tree** is one where:
1. All levels except possibly the last are completely filled
2. The last level is filled from left to right

**Analysis:**
- Level 0: $A$ (filled) ✓
- Level 1: $B, C$ (completely filled) ✓
- Level 2: $D, E$ (children of $B$, filled left-to-right) ✓

Node $C$ has no children, which is acceptable since we fill level 2 from left (under $B$) before adding children to $C$.

**Conclusion:** Yes, this is a **complete binary tree**. $\square$

---

### Problem 6: Almost Complete Binary Tree

**Task:** Create an example of an "almost complete" binary tree with 5 nodes. Label the levels.

**Solution:**

Note: "Almost complete" typically means one node short of being complete.

**Example:**

```
Level 0:      A
            /   \
Level 1:   B     C
          /
Level 2: D
```

Missing node: The right child of $B$ is absent, creating a gap.

With 5 nodes in a more standard interpretation:

```
Level 0:      A
            /   \
Level 1:   B     C
          / \
Level 2: D   E
```

If we interpret "almost complete" as "complete but not full," this tree is actually complete. $\square$

---

### Problem 7: Tree Properties Analysis

Given the tree:

```
   X
  /
 Y
/ \
Z  W
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Total number of nodes
(b) Degree of $X$, $Y$, $Z$
(c) Count of leaves

**Solution:**

(a) **Total nodes:** 4 ($\{X, Y, Z, W\}$) ✓

(b) **Degrees:**
- $\deg(X) = 1$ (one child: $Y$)
- $\deg(Y) = 3$ (one parent $X$ and two children $Z, W$)
- $\deg(Z) = 1$ (one parent: $Y$)

(c) **Leaves:** $\{Z, W\}$ (vertices with no children)

**Count: 2 leaves** $\square$

---

### Problem 8: Complete vs. Almost Complete

Consider the binary tree:

```
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   / \   /
  4   5 6
```

**Task:** Is it complete or "almost complete"? Explain.

**Solution:**

**Analysis:**
- Level 0: Node 1 (filled) ✓
- Level 1: Nodes 2, 3 (completely filled) ✓
- Level 2: Nodes 4, 5, 6 (filled left-to-right under nodes 2 and 3)
  - Under node 2: both children present ✓
  - Under node 3: only left child present ✓

This follows the complete binary tree property (all levels filled except last, last level filled left-to-right).

**Conclusion:** This is a **complete binary tree**. $\square$

---

### Problem 9: Edge Count in Trees

**Question:** How many edges exist in a tree having 12 vertices?

**Formula:** $|E| = |V| - 1$

**Solution:**

For a tree with $n = 12$ vertices:
$$|E| = 12 - 1 = 11$$

**Answer: 11 edges** $\square$

---

### Problem 10: Binary Tree with Height Constraint

**Task:** Draw a binary tree where height = 3 and number of nodes is between 5-7. Label levels 0, 1, 2, 3.

**Solution:**

**Example with 6 nodes:**

```
Level 0:       A
             /
Level 1:    B
           / \
Level 2:  C   D
         /
Level 3: E
```

Wait, this only uses one branch. Let me create a more balanced example:

```
Level 0:       A
             /   \
Level 1:    B     C
           /
Level 2:  D
         /
Level 3: E
```

**Properties:**
- Height: 3 (longest path: $A \to B \to D \to E$) ✓
- Nodes: 5 ✓
- All levels labeled $\square$

### Problem 11: Binary Tree Validity

Consider the structure:

```
    A
   / \
  B   C
 / \
D   E
 \
  F
```

**Task:** Determine if this is a valid binary tree. Explain whether every node has ≤ 2 children.

**Solution:**

**Analysis of children count:**
- $A$: 2 children ($B, C$) ✓
- $B$: 2 children ($D, E$) ✓
- $C$: 0 children ✓
- $D$: 1 child ($F$) ✓
- $E$: 0 children ✓
- $F$: 0 children ✓

All nodes have at most 2 children.

**Conclusion:** Yes, this is a **valid binary tree**. $\square$

---

### Problem 12: General Tree to Binary Tree Conversion

Given the general tree:

```
A
├─B
├─C
└─D
```

**Task:** Convert to binary tree using the left-child right-sibling method.

**Solution:**

**Left-child right-sibling representation:**

In this method:
- Left child pointer → first child
- Right child pointer → next sibling

**Binary tree:**

```
   A
  /
 B
  \
   C
    \
     D
```

**Explanation:**
- $A$'s left child is $B$ (first child)
- $B$'s right child is $C$ (next sibling of $B$)
- $C$'s right child is $D$ (next sibling of $C$) $\square$

### Problem 13: Full vs. Complete Trees

**Questions:**
(a) Is every full binary tree complete?
(b) Is every complete binary tree full?

Provide examples for each.

**Solution:**

(a) **Is every full binary tree complete?**

**No.**

**Counter-example:**
```
       A
     /   \
    B     C
   / \
  D   E
```

This is full (all internal nodes have 2 children) but not complete (node $C$ should have children before adding more depth under $B$).

(b) **Is every complete binary tree full?**

**No.**

**Counter-example:**
```
     A
   /   \
  B     C
 /
D
```

This is complete (filled left-to-right) but not full ($B$ has only 1 child). $\square$

---

### Problem 14: Height and Level Calculation

Given the tree:

```
       A
     /   \
    B     C
   / \
  D   E
     /
    G
```

**Task:** Find the height and level of nodes $A$, $D$, $G$.

**Solution:**

**Levels** (distance from root):
- Level of $A$: 0 (root)
- Level of $D$: 2 (path: $A \to B \to D$)
- Level of $G$: 3 (path: $A \to B \to E \to G$)

**Heights** (longest path to any leaf):
- Height of $A$: 3 (longest path: $A \to B \to E \to G$)
- Height of $D$: 0 (leaf node)
- Height of $G$: 0 (leaf node)

**Summary:**

| Node | Level | Height |
|------|-------|--------|
| A    | 0     | 3      |
| D    | 2     | 0      |
| G    | 3     | 0      | $\square$

### Problem 15: Tree Type Classification

Given the binary tree:

```
   P
  / \
 Q   R
/
S
```

**Tasks:** Determine if the tree is:
- Full?
- Complete?
- Explain using tree properties.

**Solution:**

(a) **Full binary tree?**

**No.** Node $Q$ has only 1 child ($S$), but in a full binary tree, all internal nodes must have exactly 2 children.

(b) **Complete binary tree?**

**No.** In a complete binary tree, all levels except the last should be completely filled. Here, level 1 has nodes $Q$ and $R$, but only $Q$ has a child. For completeness, $R$ should have children before adding children to $Q$ (or $Q$ should have both children before $R$ has any).

**Conclusion:** This tree is **neither full nor complete**. It is simply a valid binary tree. $\square$
