## Problems

### Problem 1: Graph Elements

Consider the following graph $G$:

```
A ----- B
| \     |
|  \    |
D ----- C
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Write the vertex set $V(G)$
(b) Write the edge set $E(G)$
(c) Find the degree of each vertex

**Solution:**

(a) **Vertex set:**
$$V(G) = \{A, B, C, D\}$$

(b) **Edge set:**
$$E(G) = \{\{A,B\}, \{A,C\}, \{A,D\}, \{B,C\}, \{C,D\}\}$$

(c) **Degrees:**
- $\deg(A) = 3$ (connected to $B, C, D$)
- $\deg(B) = 2$ (connected to $A, C$)
- $\deg(C) = 4$ (connected to $A, B, D$ and diagonal to $A$)
- $\deg(D) = 2$ (connected to $A, C$)

**Verification using Handshaking Lemma:**
$$\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 3 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 11$$

Wait, this should be even. Let me recount the edges from the diagram:
- $A$ connects to: $B, C, D$ (degree 3)
- $B$ connects to: $A, C$ (degree 2)
- $C$ connects to: $A, B, D$ (degree 3)
- $D$ connects to: $A, C$ (degree 2)

Sum = $3 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 10 = 2 \times 5$. This matches 5 edges. ✓

### Problem 2: Cycle Detection

Given the graph:

```
P ---- Q
|    / |
|   /  |
R ---- S
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Count the number of vertices and edges
(b) Write any cycle present in the graph

**Solution:**

(a) **Count:**
- Vertices: $|V| = 4$ (vertices $P, Q, R, S$)
- Edges: $|E| = 5$ (edges $\{P,Q\}, \{P,R\}, \{Q,R\}, \{Q,S\}, \{R,S\}$)

(b) **Cycles:**

There are multiple cycles:
- $P \to Q \to R \to P$ (length 3)
- $P \to Q \to S \to R \to P$ (length 4)
- $Q \to R \to S \to Q$ (length 3)

One example: **$(P, Q, R, P)$** $\square$

### Problem 3: Degrees and Paths

Given the graph:

```
1 ---- 2
|      |
|      |
4 ---- 3
 \    /
   5
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Find $\deg(1)$, $\deg(3)$, $\deg(5)$
(b) Write a path from $1$ to $3$

**Solution:**

(a) **Degrees:**
- $\deg(1) = 2$ (edges to $2, 4$)
- $\deg(3) = 3$ (edges to $2, 4, 5$)
- $\deg(5) = 2$ (edges to $3, 4$)

(b) **Path from 1 to 3:**

Multiple paths exist. Examples:
- $1 \to 2 \to 3$ (length 2)
- $1 \to 4 \to 3$ (length 2)

```
A --- B --- C
|     |
D --- E
```

**Tasks:**

(b) Count the number of cycles

$$E = \{\{A,B\}, \{A,D\}, \{B,C\}, \{B,E\}, \{D,E\}\}$$

Total edges: $|E| = 5$

(b) **Cycles:**

Only one cycle exists: **$A \to B \to E \to D \to A$** (length 4)

Number of cycles: **1** $\square$

### Problem 5: Connectivity

Given the graph:

```
M --- N
|   / |
|  /  |
O --- P --- Q
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Find the number of vertices and edges
(b) Determine if the graph is connected

**Solution:**

(a) **Count:**
- Vertices: $|V| = 5$ ($M, N, O, P, Q$)
- Edges: $|E| = 6$ ($\{M,N\}, \{M,O\}, \{N,O\}, \{N,P\}, \{O,P\}, \{P,Q\}$)

(b) **Connectivity:**

To check connectivity, we verify if there exists a path between every pair of vertices.

Starting from $M$, we can reach:
- $M \to N$ (direct)
- $M \to O$ (direct)
- $M \to N \to P$
- $M \to N \to P \to Q$

All vertices are reachable from $M$.

**The graph is connected.** ✓ $\square$

### Problem 6: Path Identification

Given the graph:

```

 \   |   /
   \ | /
     Z
```

(b) Write one simple path from $W$ to $Y$

**Solution:**

(a) **Degrees:**
- $\deg(W) = 2$ (edges to $X, Z$)
- $\deg(X) = 3$ (edges to $W, Y, Z$)
- $\deg(Y) = 2$ (edges to $X, Z$)
- $\deg(Z) = 3$ (edges to $W, X, Y$)

Sum of degrees: $2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 10 = 2 \times 5$ ✓

(b) **Simple path from $W$ to $Y$:**

Options:
- $W \to X \to Y$ (length 2)
- $W \to Z \to Y$ (length 2)

One simple path: **$W \to X \to Y$** $\square$

### Problem 7: Cycle Recognition

Given the graph:

```
H ----- I
| \     |
|  \    |
J ----- K ----- L
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Identify any cycle of length 4
(b) Write all edges incident on $K$

**Solution:**

(a) **Cycle of length 4:**

The cycle $H \to I \to K \to J \to H$ has length 4.

Cycle: **$(H, I, K, J, H)$** ✓

(b) **Edges incident on $K$:**

Vertex $K$ is adjacent to: $I, J, L$

Edges incident on $K$: **$\{\{I,K\}, \{J,K\}, \{K,L\}\}$** $\square$

### Problem 8: Path Validation

Given the graph:

```
2 --- 3 --- 4
|    /     /
|   /     /
1        5
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Count the edges
(b) Check if $(2 \to 4 \to 5)$ is a valid path

**Solution:**

(a) **Edge count:**

Edges: $\{1,2\}, \{2,3\}, \{3,4\}, \{1,3\}, \{4,5\}$

Total edges: $|E| = 5$

(b) **Path validation:**

For $(2 \to 4 \to 5)$ to be valid:
- Edge $\{2,4\}$ must exist: **No** (only $\{2,3\}$ and $\{3,4\}$ exist)

Therefore, $(2 \to 4 \to 5)$ is **not a valid path**.

A valid path from $2$ to $5$ would be: $2 \to 3 \to 4 \to 5$ $\square$

### Problem 9: Multiple Paths

Given the graph:

```
A ---- B ---- C
       |
       |
       D
```

**Tasks:**
(a) Find $\deg(B)$
(b) Write two different paths from $A$ to $D$

**Solution:**

(a) **Degree of $B$:**

$B$ is adjacent to: $A, C, D$

$\deg(B) = 3$ ✓

(b) **Two different paths from $A$ to $D$:**

Path 1: $A \to B \to D$ (length 2)

Path 2: $A \to B \to C \to B \to D$... wait, this revisits $B$, so it's not simple.

Actually, since the graph structure is:
```
A ---- B ---- C
       |
       D
```

The only simple path from $A$ to $D$ is: $A \to B \to D$

If we want a different walk (allowing repeated vertices):
- Walk 1: $A \to B \to D$
- Walk 2: $A \to B \to C \to B \to D$

**Two different paths (one simple, one non-simple):**
1. $A \to B \to D$ (simple)
2. $A \to B \to C \to B \to D$ (non-simple walk) $\square$
