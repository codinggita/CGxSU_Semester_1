## Definitions and Theoretical Foundations

### Definition 2.1 (Simple Graph)

A **simple graph** is an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ where:
1. No edge connects a vertex to itself (no self-loops)
2. No two edges connect the same pair of vertices (no multiple edges)

Formally: $E \subseteq \{\{u, v\} : u, v \in V, u \neq v\}$

### Definition 2.2 (Multigraph)

A **multigraph** permits multiple edges between the same pair of vertices but no self-loops.

Formally, $E$ is a multiset of unordered pairs from $V$, allowing repetition.

### Definition 2.3 (Pseudograph)

A **pseudograph** permits both multiple edges and self-loops.

### Definition 2.4 (Directed Graph - Digraph)

A **directed graph** or **digraph** $D = (V, A)$ consists of:
- A finite set $V$ of vertices
- A set $A$ of **arcs** (directed edges), where each arc is an ordered pair $(u, v)$ with $u, v \in V$

**Terminology:**
- Arc $(u, v)$ goes **from** $u$ **to** $v$
- $u$ is the **tail** (or initial vertex)
- $v$ is the **head** (or terminal vertex)
- $u$ is a **predecessor** of $v$
- $v$ is a **successor** of $u$

### Definition 2.5 (Weighted Graph)

A **weighted graph** is a graph $G = (V, E)$ together with a weight function $w: E \to \mathbb{R}$ assigning a real number (weight) to each edge.

Weights commonly represent:
- Distance or length
- Cost or price
- Capacity or bandwidth
- Time duration
- Probability or strength

### Definition 2.6 (Complete Graph)

The **complete graph** on $n$ vertices, denoted $K_n$, is a simple graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by exactly one edge.

**Properties:**
- Number of vertices: $n$
- Number of edges: $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$
- Degree of every vertex: $n - 1$ (maximum possible in simple graph)

### Theorem 2.1 (Complete Graph Edge Count)

For the complete graph $K_n$ with $n$ vertices:
$$|E(K_n)| = \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$

**Proof:**

Each edge connects two distinct vertices. The number of ways to choose 2 vertices from $n$ is $\binom{n}{2}$. In a complete graph, all such pairs are connected, giving $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ edges. $\square$

### Definition 2.7 (Bipartite Graph)

A graph $G = (V, E)$ is **bipartite** if its vertex set can be partitioned into two disjoint sets $V_1$ and $V_2$ such that every edge connects a vertex in $V_1$ to a vertex in $V_2$.

Formally: $V = V_1 \cup V_2$, $V_1 \cap V_2 = \emptyset$, and for all $\{u, v\} \in E$: either $u \in V_1, v \in V_2$ or $u \in V_2, v \in V_1$.

**Complete Bipartite Graph:** Denoted $K_{m,n}$, has all possible edges between $V_1$ (with $m$ vertices) and $V_2$ (with $n$ vertices).

Number of edges in $K_{m,n}$: $m \cdot n$

### Theorem 2.2 (Bipartite Characterization)

A graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd-length cycles.

**Proof Sketch:**

($\Rightarrow$) If $G$ is bipartite with partition $(V_1, V_2)$, any cycle alternates between $V_1$ and $V_2$, requiring an even number of vertices.

($\Leftarrow$) If $G$ has no odd cycles and is connected, use a 2-coloring algorithm: pick a vertex, color it, color neighbors with opposite color, repeat. No odd cycles ensures no conflict. $\square$

### Definition 2.8 (Regular Graph)

A graph is **$k$-regular** if every vertex has degree $k$.

Examples:
- **0-regular:** Discrete vertices (no edges)
- **1-regular:** Perfect matching
- **2-regular:** Disjoint cycles
- **3-regular:** Cubic graph

### Definition 2.9 (Cycle Graph)

The **cycle graph** $C_n$ on $n$ vertices ($n \geq 3$) is a connected 2-regular graph.

**Properties:**
- Number of vertices: $n$
- Number of edges: $n$
- Degree of every vertex: 2

### Definition 2.10 (Path Graph)

The **path graph** $P_n$ on $n$ vertices is a tree with two vertices of degree 1 and $n-2$ vertices of degree 2.

**Properties:**
- Number of vertices: $n$
- Number of edges: $n - 1$

### Definition 2.11 (Star Graph)

A **star graph** $S_n$ consists of one central vertex connected to $n$ other vertices, with no other edges.

**Properties:**
- Total vertices: $n + 1$
- Edges: $n$
- Central vertex degree: $n$
- All other vertices degree: 1

### Definition 2.12 (Wheel Graph)

A **wheel graph** $W_n$ is formed by connecting a single vertex (hub) to all vertices of a cycle $C_n$.

**Properties:**
- Vertices: $n + 1$
- Edges: $2n$

## Worked Examples

### Example 1 (Simple): Identifying Graph Types

**Problem:** Classify each graph:

(a) $V = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, $E = \{\{1,2\}, \{2,3\}, \{3,4\}, \{4,1\}\}$

(b) $V = \{A, B, C\}$, $A = \{(A,B), (B,C), (C,A)\}$ (directed)

(c) $V = \{1, 2, 3\}$, $E = \{\{1,2\}, \{1,2\}, \{2,3\}\}$ (multiple edges)

**Solution:**

(a) **Simple graph** and **cycle graph** $C_4$. Each vertex has degree 2, no loops or multiple edges.

(b) **Directed graph** (digraph) forming a **directed cycle**.

(c) **Multigraph** (two edges between vertices 1 and 2). $\square$

### Example 2 (Intermediate): Complete Graph Properties

**Problem:** For the complete graph $K_5$:
(a) How many edges does it have?
(b) What is the degree of each vertex?
(c) Verify the Handshaking Lemma.

**Solution:**

(a) Number of edges:
$$|E(K_5)| = \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10$$

(b) Each vertex connects to all others:
$$\deg(v) = 5 - 1 = 4 \text{ for all } v$$

(c) Handshaking Lemma verification:
$$\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 5 \cdot 4 = 20 = 2 \cdot 10 = 2|E|$$ ✓ $\square$

---

### Example 3 (Intermediate): Bipartite Recognition

**Problem:** Determine if the following graph is bipartite:
$V = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$, $E = \{\{1,2\}, \{2,3\}, \{3,4\}, \{4,5\}, \{5,6\}, \{6,1\}\}$

**Solution:**

The graph forms a cycle $C_6$: $1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 1$.

Cycle length = 6 (even).

By Theorem 2.2, a graph is bipartite if and only if it has no odd cycles. Since this graph is a single even cycle, it is bipartite.

Explicit partition:
- $V_1 = \{1, 3, 5\}$
- $V_2 = \{2, 4, 6\}$

All edges connect vertices from different partitions. ✓

**Answer:** Yes, bipartite. $\square$

---

### Example 4 (Challenging): Regular Graph Construction

**Problem:** Does there exist a 3-regular graph with 7 vertices?

**Solution:**

For a $k$-regular graph with $n$ vertices, the sum of degrees is $kn$.

By the Handshaking Lemma: $kn = 2|E|$, so $kn$ must be even.

For $k = 3$ and $n = 7$:
$$kn = 3 \cdot 7 = 21$$

This is odd, so $kn = 2|E|$ cannot hold.

**Answer:** No, such a graph cannot exist. $\square$

---

### Example 5 (Challenging): Weighted Graph Shortest Path

**Problem:** Given a weighted graph:
- Vertices: $\{A, B, C, D\}$
- Edges with weights: $(A,B):2$, $(A,C):4$, $(B,C):1$, $(B,D):7$, $(C,D):3$

Find the shortest path from $A$ to $D$ and its total weight.

**Solution:**

Possible paths from $A$ to $D$:

1. $A \to B \to D$: weight $= 2 + 7 = 9$
2. $A \to C \to D$: weight $= 4 + 3 = 7$
3. $A \to B \to C \to D$: weight $= 2 + 1 + 3 = 6$

The shortest path is $A \to B \to C \to D$ with total weight **6**. $\square$

---

### Example 6 (Advanced): Complete Bipartite Graph

**Problem:** In $K_{3,4}$:
(a) How many edges are there?
(b) What are the possible vertex degrees?
(c) Is it possible to traverse all edges exactly once?

**Solution:**

(a) Complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$ has $m \cdot n$ edges:
$$|E(K_{3,4})| = 3 \cdot 4 = 12$$

(b) Vertices in the partition of size 3 each have degree 4 (connected to all 4 vertices in the other partition).

Vertices in the partition of size 4 each have degree 3.

Degree sequence: $(4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3)$

(c) An Eulerian path exists if and only if exactly 0 or 2 vertices have odd degree.

Here, 4 vertices have odd degree (3), so no Eulerian path exists.

**Answer:** (a) 12 edges, (b) Degrees are 3 or 4, (c) No. $\square$

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

How many edges does the complete graph $K_8$ have?

**Hint:** Use the formula $\binom{n}{2}$.

**Solution:**
$$|E(K_8)| = \binom{8}{2} = \frac{8 \cdot 7}{2} = 28$$

---

### Exercise 2

Determine whether a 5-regular graph with 8 vertices can exist.

**Hint:** Check if the sum of degrees is even.

**Solution:**
Sum of degrees = $5 \cdot 8 = 40$, which is even. By Handshaking Lemma, this gives $|E| = 20$.

Additionally, in a simple graph with 8 vertices, the maximum degree is 7. Since 5 ≤ 7, this is feasible.

**Answer:** Yes, it can exist.

---

### Exercise 3

Prove that $K_{2,3}$ is bipartite.

**Hint:** Show an explicit partition.

**Solution:**
By definition, $K_{2,3}$ is the complete bipartite graph with partitions $V_1 = \{a, b\}$ and $V_2 = \{c, d, e\}$.

All edges connect vertices from different partitions: $\{a,c\}, \{a,d\}, \{a,e\}, \{b,c\}, \{b,d\}, \{b,e\}$.

Therefore, it is bipartite. $\square$

---

### Exercise 4

Show that a graph containing a triangle ($K_3$) cannot be bipartite.

**Hint:** Use the odd-cycle characterization.

**Solution:**
A triangle is a cycle of length 3 (odd). By Theorem 2.2, a graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd cycles. Since the graph contains a 3-cycle, it cannot be bipartite. $\square$

---

### Exercise 5

In a weighted graph, two paths between vertices $A$ and $B$ have lengths 10 and 15. Can we conclude that 10 is the shortest path length?

**Hint:** Consider other possible paths.

**Solution:**
No. There may exist other paths not yet examined with shorter lengths. To confirm 10 is the shortest, we must either:
- Examine all paths (exponential in size)
- Use an algorithm like Dijkstra's that guarantees finding the shortest path

**Answer:** No, we cannot conclude without further analysis. $\square$

---

### Exercise 6 (Challenge)

Prove that a $k$-regular bipartite graph $G = (V_1 \cup V_2, E)$ has $|V_1| = |V_2|$.

**Hint:** Count edges from each partition.

**Solution:**
Since $G$ is $k$-regular, every vertex has degree $k$.

Count edges by summing degrees in $V_1$:
$$|E| = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = \frac{1}{2}(k|V_1| + k|V_2|)$$

But in a bipartite graph, we can also count by noting that every edge connects $V_1$ to $V_2$:
$$\sum_{v \in V_1} \deg(v) = |E| = \sum_{v \in V_2} \deg(v)$$

Since every vertex has degree $k$:
$$k|V_1| = |E| = k|V_2|$$

Dividing by $k$:
$$|V_1| = |V_2|$$ $\square$

---

### Exercise 7 (Challenge)

How many different simple graphs can be constructed on $n$ labeled vertices?

**Hint:** Consider each possible edge independently.

**Solution:**
For $n$ labeled vertices, there are $\binom{n}{2}$ possible edges (each pair of vertices may or may not have an edge).

Each edge can either be present or absent (2 choices).

Total number of simple graphs:
$$2^{\binom{n}{2}} = 2^{n(n-1)/2}$$

For $n = 4$: $2^{6} = 64$ different simple graphs. $\square$

## Common Mistakes and Misconceptions

1. **Complete vs. connected:** A complete graph has ALL possible edges; a connected graph only needs enough edges for paths between all pairs.

2. **Bipartite edge count:** In $K_{m,n}$, there are $m \cdot n$ edges, not $m + n$.

3. **Regular graphs and evenness:** A $k$-regular graph on $n$ vertices requires $kn$ to be even (for the edge count to be an integer).

4. **Directed graph degrees:** In a digraph, be careful to distinguish in-degree, out-degree, and total degree.

5. **Weighted graph distances:** Edge weight ≠ graph-theoretic distance. Weights represent application-specific quantities.

## Summary and Key Takeaways

1. **Simple graphs:** No loops, no multiple edges. Most common theoretical model.

2. **Directed graphs:** Edges have direction, modeling asymmetric relationships.

3. **Weighted graphs:** Edges have numerical values for optimization problems.

4. **Complete graphs $K_n$:** All possible edges, with $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ edges.

5. **Bipartite graphs:** Vertices split into two sets, edges only between sets. Characterized by absence of odd cycles.

6. **Regular graphs:** All vertices have the same degree.

7. **Special families:** Cycles $C_n$, paths $P_n$, stars $S_n$, wheels $W_n$ have specific structural properties.
