## Definitions and Theoretical Foundations

### Definition 1.1 (Graph)

A **graph** $G$ is an ordered pair $G = (V, E)$ where:
- $V$ is a non-empty finite set of **vertices** (or nodes)
- $E$ is a set of **edges**, where each edge is either:
  - An unordered pair $\{u, v\}$ with $u, v \in V$ (undirected graph), or
  - An ordered pair $(u, v)$ with $u, v \in V$ (directed graph)

**Notation:**
- $V(G)$ denotes the vertex set of graph $G$
- $E(G)$ denotes the edge set of graph $G$
- $|V(G)| = n$ is the **order** of the graph
- $|E(G)| = m$ is the **size** of the graph

### Definition 1.2 (Types of Graphs)

**Simple Graph:** A graph with no self-loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.

**Multigraph:** A graph that may contain multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.

**Directed Graph (Digraph):** A graph where edges have direction, represented as ordered pairs $(u, v)$.

**Undirected Graph:** A graph where edges have no direction, represented as unordered pairs $\{u, v\}$.

**Weighted Graph:** A graph with a weight function $w: E \to \mathbb{R}$ assigning a numerical value to each edge.

### Definition 1.3 (Adjacency and Incidence)

Two vertices $u$ and $v$ are **adjacent** if there exists an edge $\{u, v\} \in E$.

An edge $e = \{u, v\}$ is **incident** to vertices $u$ and $v$.

The **neighborhood** of vertex $v$, denoted $N(v)$, is the set of all vertices adjacent to $v$:
$$N(v) = \{u \in V : \{u, v\} \in E\}$$

### Definition 1.4 (Degree)

For an undirected graph, the **degree** of a vertex $v$, denoted $\deg(v)$ or $d(v)$, is the number of edges incident to $v$. Self-loops count twice.

For a directed graph:
- **In-degree** $\deg^-(v)$: number of edges entering $v$
- **Out-degree** $\deg^+(v)$: number of edges leaving $v$
- **Total degree**: $\deg(v) = \deg^-(v) + \deg^+(v)$

**Special vertices:**
- A vertex with degree 0 is **isolated**
- A vertex with degree 1 is a **pendant** (or leaf) vertex

### Theorem 1.1 (Handshaking Lemma)

For any undirected graph $G = (V, E)$:
$$\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 2|E|$$

**Proof:**

Each edge $\{u, v\}$ contributes exactly 1 to $\deg(u)$ and exactly 1 to $\deg(v)$. Therefore, each edge contributes exactly 2 to the sum of all degrees. Since there are $|E|$ edges, the total sum is $2|E|$. $\square$

### Corollary 1.2

In any graph, the number of vertices with odd degree is even.

**Proof:**

Let $V_{odd}$ and $V_{even}$ be the sets of vertices with odd and even degree, respectively. By the Handshaking Lemma:
$$\sum_{v \in V_{odd}} \deg(v) + \sum_{v \in V_{even}} \deg(v) = 2|E|$$

The right side is even. The second sum on the left is even (sum of even numbers). Therefore, the first sum must be even. Since each term in the first sum is odd, there must be an even number of such terms. Hence $|V_{odd}|$ is even. $\square$

### Definition 1.5 (Path and Cycle)

A **path** is a sequence of vertices $v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_k$ such that $\{v_{i-1}, v_i\} \in E$ for all $i = 1, \ldots, k$. The **length** of the path is $k$ (the number of edges).

A **simple path** has no repeated vertices (except possibly the first and last).

A **cycle** is a path where $v_0 = v_k$ and $k \geq 3$, with no other repeated vertices.

A **simple cycle** has no repeated vertices except $v_0 = v_k$.

### Definition 1.6 (Connectivity)

A graph is **connected** if there exists a path between every pair of distinct vertices.

A **connected component** of a graph is a maximal connected subgraph (cannot be extended by adding more vertices while remaining connected).

The **distance** between vertices $u$ and $v$, denoted $d(u, v)$, is the length of the shortest path from $u$ to $v$. If no path exists, $d(u, v) = \infty$.

### Definition 1.7 (Subgraph)

A graph $H = (V', E')$ is a **subgraph** of $G = (V, E)$ if $V' \subseteq V$ and $E' \subseteq E$.

An **induced subgraph** on vertex set $V' \subseteq V$ contains all edges of $G$ that have both endpoints in $V'$:
$$E' = \{\{u, v\} \in E : u, v \in V'\}$$

A **spanning subgraph** has $V' = V$.

## Worked Examples

### Example 1 (Simple): Verifying the Handshaking Lemma

**Problem:** Consider the graph with $V = \{A, B, C, D\}$ and edges $E = \{\{A,B\}, \{B,C\}, \{C,D\}, \{D,A\}, \{A,C\}\}$. Verify the Handshaking Lemma.

**Solution:**

First, determine the degree of each vertex:
- $\deg(A) = 3$ (connected to $B, C, D$)
- $\deg(B) = 2$ (connected to $A, C$)
- $\deg(C) = 3$ (connected to $A, B, D$)
- $\deg(D) = 2$ (connected to $A, C$)

Sum of degrees:
$$\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 10$$

Number of edges: $|E| = 5$

Check: $2|E| = 2(5) = 10$ ✓

The Handshaking Lemma is verified. $\square$

---

### Example 2 (Intermediate): Proving Impossibility

**Problem:** Can there exist a graph with 7 vertices where the degrees are: 6, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1?

**Solution:**

By the Handshaking Lemma, the sum of degrees must be even.

Sum of proposed degrees:
$$6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 24$$

This is even, so the sum criterion is satisfied.

However, we must check if such a graph is constructible. The maximum degree is 6, which means one vertex is connected to all other 6 vertices. This is possible in a simple graph of order 7.

Let's construct it:
- Vertex $v_1$ has degree 6: connect to all others
- Vertex $v_2$ has degree 5: already connected to $v_1$, need 4 more
- Vertex $v_3$ has degree 4: already connected to $v_1$, need 3 more
- And so on...

After systematic construction (connecting $v_2$ to $v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6$; $v_3$ to $v_4, v_5, v_6$; etc.), we can verify this is constructible.

**Answer:** Yes, such a graph can exist. $\square$

---

### Example 3 (Intermediate): Paths and Distances

**Problem:** In the graph $G$ with $V = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and edges $\{\{1,2\}, \{2,3\}, \{3,4\}, \{4,5\}, \{2,4\}\}$, find:
(a) All paths from vertex 1 to vertex 5
(b) The distance $d(1, 5)$

**Solution:**

**(a) Paths from 1 to 5:**

Path 1: $1 \to 2 \to 3 \to 4 \to 5$ (length 4)

Path 2: $1 \to 2 \to 4 \to 5$ (length 3)

Path 3: $1 \to 2 \to 4 \to 3 \to 4 \to 5$ (length 5, not simple)

The simple paths are Path 1 and Path 2.

**(b) Distance:**

The shortest path is Path 2 with length 3.

Therefore, $d(1, 5) = 3$. $\square$

---

### Example 4 (Challenging): Connected Components

**Problem:** A graph $G$ has 10 vertices and 12 edges. If $G$ has exactly 3 connected components, what is the minimum and maximum number of edges in the largest component?

**Solution:**

Let the three components have $n_1, n_2, n_3$ vertices and $e_1, e_2, e_3$ edges.

Constraints:
- $n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 10$
- $e_1 + e_2 + e_3 = 12$
- Each connected component with $n_i$ vertices has at least $n_i - 1$ edges (for a tree) and at most $\binom{n_i}{2}$ edges (complete graph)

**Minimum edges in largest component:**

To minimize the largest component's edges, distribute edges as evenly as possible. However, we need at least $n_i - 1$ edges per component to keep it connected.

If components have sizes $(8, 1, 1)$:
- Minimum total edges: $7 + 0 + 0 = 7$
- We have 12 edges, so 5 extra edges go somewhere

If components have sizes $(4, 3, 3)$:
- Minimum total: $3 + 2 + 2 = 7$
- Distribute 5 extra edges: could be $(5, 3, 4)$ edges per component
- Largest has 5 edges

**Maximum edges in largest component:**

To maximize one component's edges, minimize others. With sizes $(8, 1, 1)$:
- Small components contribute 0 edges
- Large component gets all 12 edges
- Check: $\binom{8}{2} = 28$, so 12 edges is feasible

**Answer:** Minimum = 5 edges, Maximum = 12 edges. $\square$

### Example 5 (Advanced): Degree Sequence Realizability

**Problem:** Prove that the degree sequence $(4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2)$ cannot be realized by a simple graph.

**Solution:**

**Method 1: Handshaking Lemma**

Sum of degrees: $4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 18 = 2(9)$

This is even, so it passes the first test.

**Method 2: Erdős-Gallai Theorem (Simplified Check)**

For a simple graph with $n = 6$ vertices, the maximum degree is $n - 1 = 5$.

All degrees ≤ 5, so this passes.

**Method 3: Direct Construction Attempt**

Let vertices be $\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6\}$ with degrees $\{4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2\}$.

$v_1$ (degree 4): must connect to 4 others. In a graph with 6 vertices, cannot connect to itself, so connects to 4 of the remaining 5.

$v_2$ (degree 4): also connects to 4 others.

If both $v_1$ and $v_2$ connect to each other, they each need 3 more connections from $\{v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6\}$.

If $v_1$ connects to $v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5$ and $v_2$ connects to $v_1, v_3, v_4, v_6$:
- $v_3$ has degree ≥ 2 (from $v_1, v_2$)
- $v_4$ has degree ≥ 2 (from $v_1, v_2$)
- $v_5$ has degree ≥ 1 (from $v_1$)
- $v_6$ has degree ≥ 1 (from $v_2$)

We need $v_3$ and $v_4$ to have degree exactly 3, and $v_5, v_6$ to have degree exactly 2.

$v_3$ needs 1 more edge: to $v_5$ or $v_6$
$v_4$ needs 1 more edge: to $v_5$ or $v_6$
$v_5$ needs 1 more edge
$v_6$ needs 1 more edge

If $v_3 - v_5$ and $v_4 - v_6$: degrees are $(4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2)$ ✓

Actually, this IS realizable! Let me reconsider the problem.

The graph:
- $v_1 - v_2, v_1 - v_3, v_1 - v_4, v_1 - v_5$
- $v_2 - v_3, v_2 - v_4, v_2 - v_6$
- $v_3 - v_5$
- $v_4 - v_6$

Checking degrees:
- $v_1$: 4 edges ✓
- $v_2$: 4 edges ✓
- $v_3$: 3 edges ($v_1, v_2, v_5$) ✓
- $v_4$: 3 edges ($v_1, v_2, v_6$) ✓
- $v_5$: 2 edges ($v_1, v_3$) ✓
- $v_6$: 2 edges ($v_2, v_4$) ✓

**Correction:** The degree sequence $(4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2)$ CAN be realized.

**Better example for non-realizability: $(5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1)$**

Sum = 16 (even) ✓, but vertex with degree 5 connects to all others, forcing minimum degree 1 for all. The vertex with degree 5 forces all others to have degree ≥ 1, but then the total would be at least $5 + 5(1) = 10$ additional, exceeding our sum. This requires careful verification. $\square$

## Applications and Intuition

### Computer Science

**Networks:** Graph theory models computer networks, where vertices are devices and edges are connections. Routing algorithms find paths through these graphs.

**Data Structures:** Many data structures (trees, linked lists) are special graphs.

### Social Networks

Vertices represent users, edges represent relationships (friendship, following). Analyzing degree distributions reveals influential users.

### Transportation

Road networks, airline routes, and public transit systems are modeled as weighted graphs for route optimization.

### Biology

Protein interaction networks, neural networks, and food webs use graph structures.

### Web Search

The World Wide Web is a directed graph where pages are vertices and hyperlinks are edges. Google's PageRank algorithm ranks pages based on this graph structure.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

In a graph with 8 vertices, each vertex has degree 3. How many edges does the graph have?

**Hint:** Use the Handshaking Lemma.

**Solution:**
$$\sum \deg(v) = 8 \times 3 = 24 = 2|E|$$
Therefore, $|E| = 12$ edges.

---

### Exercise 2

Can there exist a simple graph with 6 vertices having degrees: 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1?

**Hint:** Check the Handshaking Lemma and try construction.

**Solution:**
Sum = $5 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 18 = 2(9)$ ✓

The vertex with degree 5 connects to all others. After accounting for this, remaining degrees are: $4, 3, 3, 2, 1$ must become $3, 2, 2, 1, 0$. The sum is $3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 8$, which should equal $2 \times \text{(remaining edges)} = 2 \times 4 = 8$ ✓. Such a graph exists.

---

### Exercise 3

Prove that in any group of 6 people, there are either 3 mutual acquaintances or 3 mutual strangers.

**Hint:** Model as a graph coloring problem (Ramsey theory).

**Solution:** This is the Ramsey number $R(3, 3) = 6$. Consider person $A$: by pigeonhole principle, among 5 others, at least 3 are either friends or strangers to $A$. If 3 are friends to $A$, either they form a triangle of friends, or two are strangers (forming a stranger triangle with $A$). Detailed proof uses case analysis.

---

### Exercise 4

A connected graph has 10 vertices. What is the minimum number of edges it can have?

**Hint:** Consider a tree structure.

**Solution:**
A connected graph with $n$ vertices requires at least $n - 1$ edges (forming a tree). Therefore, minimum = $10 - 1 = 9$ edges.

---

### Exercise 5

Prove that if every vertex in a graph has degree at least 2, then the graph contains a cycle.

**Hint:** Follow a path until you must revisit a vertex.

**Solution:**
Start at any vertex $v_0$ and follow edges to form a path $v_0, v_1, v_2, \ldots$ Since each vertex has degree ≥ 2, we can always continue to a new vertex (except we might return). The graph is finite, so eventually we must revisit some vertex $v_i = v_j$ with $i < j$. The sequence $v_i, v_{i+1}, \ldots, v_j$ forms a cycle. $\square$

---

### Exercise 6 (Challenge)

A tournament is a directed graph where for every pair of distinct vertices, exactly one directed edge exists. Prove that every tournament contains a Hamiltonian path (a path visiting every vertex exactly once).

**Hint:** Use induction on the number of vertices.

**Solution:**
**Base case:** $n = 1$: trivial, single vertex.

**Inductive step:** Assume true for tournaments with $k$ vertices. For a tournament $T$ with $k + 1$ vertices, remove any vertex $v$ to get tournament $T'$ with $k$ vertices. By hypothesis, $T'$ has a Hamiltonian path $P: v_1 \to v_2 \to \cdots \to v_k$.

Now insert $v$ back. If $v \to v_1$, then $v \to v_1 \to \cdots \to v_k$ is Hamiltonian. If $v_k \to v$, then $v_1 \to \cdots \to v_k \to v$ is Hamiltonian. Otherwise, there exists $i$ where $v_i \to v$ and $v \to v_{i+1}$. Insert $v$ between them: $v_1 \to \cdots \to v_i \to v \to v_{i+1} \to \cdots \to v_k$ is Hamiltonian. $\square$

---

### Exercise 7 (Challenge)

Determine all possible degree sequences for simple graphs with 5 vertices.

**Hint:** Use the Erdős-Gallai theorem or systematic enumeration.

**Solution:** Too extensive for a complete listing, but process:
1. Sum must be even (Handshaking)
2. Each degree ≤ 4 (simple graph, no self-loops)
3. Apply Erdős-Gallai conditions

Examples: $(4,4,4,4,4)$, $(4,4,3,3,2)$, $(3,3,3,3,0)$, etc. Full enumeration yields approximately 30-40 valid sequences.

## Common Mistakes and Misconceptions

1. **Confusing order and size:** Order = number of vertices, size = number of edges. They are not interchangeable.

2. **Self-loops in degree counting:** In multigraphs, a self-loop at vertex $v$ contributes 2 to $\deg(v)$, not 1.

3. **Directed vs. undirected:** Handshaking Lemma applies directly only to undirected graphs. For directed graphs: $\sum \deg^+(v) = \sum \deg^-(v) = |E|$.

4. **Path vs. simple path:** Not all paths are simple. Paths may repeat vertices unless specified as "simple."

5. **Connected ≠ complete:** A connected graph only requires paths between all pairs. A complete graph has edges between all pairs.

## Summary and Key Takeaways

1. **Graphs** are mathematical structures $G = (V, E)$ modeling pairwise relationships.

2. **Handshaking Lemma:** $\sum \deg(v) = 2|E|$ is fundamental to counting arguments.

3. **Degree properties:** Number of odd-degree vertices is always even.

4. **Paths and cycles:** Paths connect vertices; cycles are closed paths. Distance is shortest path length.

5. **Connectivity:** A graph is connected if paths exist between all vertex pairs.

6. **Subgraphs:** Portions of larger graphs, useful for structural analysis.

7. **Graph modeling:** Real-world systems (networks, social structures, transportation) are naturally represented as graphs.
