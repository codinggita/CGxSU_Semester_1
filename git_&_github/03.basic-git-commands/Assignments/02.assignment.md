# **Git & GitHub Assignment – Mode 2: Essential System Commands for Git Users**

## **Objective**

Master the essential terminal commands used alongside Git, with plenty of examples and contexts.

---

## **Section 0 – Getting Help for Any Command**

### **Why?**

Before learning commands, students should know how to get help anytime without searching online.

**Commands:**

* See manual pages:

  ```bash
  man git
  man ls
  ```
* Get short help for Git:

  ```bash
  git help
  git help commit
  ```
* See examples of a command:

  ```bash
  git add --help
  ```
* Quick command usage:

  ```bash
  ls --help
  ```

**Git Context Example:**
If you forget how `git log` works:

```bash
git help log
```

---

## **Section 1 – Navigating the Filesystem**

### **1. `pwd` – Print Working Directory**

Shows your current folder path.

```bash
pwd
```

Git context: Verify you’re inside the repository before running Git commands.

---

### **2. `ls` – List Files**

* List files:

  ```bash
  ls
  ```
* Show hidden files (like `.git`):

  ```bash
  ls -a
  ```
* Show detailed info (permissions, owner, size):

  ```bash
  ls -l
  ```
* Sort by time modified:

  ```bash
  ls -lt
  ```

Git context: Check if `.git` exists and see which files are ready to be committed.

---

### **3. `cd` – Change Directory**

* Move into a folder:

  ```bash
  cd docs
  ```
* Move back one level:

  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```
* Go to home directory:

  ```bash
  cd ~
  ```

Git context: Navigate into the correct project folder before running `git status`.

---

## **Section 2 – Creating and Editing Files**

### **4. `touch` – Create Empty Files**

* Create one file:

  ```bash
  touch README.md
  ```
* Create multiple files:

  ```bash
  touch file1.txt file2.txt
  ```

Git context: Create placeholder files before adding to Git.

---

### **5. `nano` or `vim` – Edit Files in Terminal**

* Open file in nano:

  ```bash
  nano notes.txt
  ```
* Save and exit nano:

  * Press `CTRL + O` → `Enter` → `CTRL + X`

Git context: Quickly edit commit message files when Git opens an editor.

---

### **6. `mkdir` – Create Directories**

* Create one folder:

  ```bash
  mkdir images
  ```
* Create nested folders:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p src/components
  ```

Git context: Organize project structure before committing.

---

## **Section 3 – Removing and Moving Files**

Alright, I’ll rewrite the **remaining commands after the 7th one** from our Stage 2 article in a **beginner-friendly** style:

* **One command per block**
* **Clear step-by-step explanations**
* **Simple examples and plain language**

---

### 8. `rm` — Remove Files

**Purpose:**
`rm` is used to delete (remove) files from your computer.

**Syntax:**

```bash
rm filename
```

**Example:**

```bash
rm test.txt
```

**Explanation:**
This command will permanently delete `test.txt` from the current folder.
Unlike moving to the recycle bin, `rm` deletes the file immediately — so be careful.

---

### 9. `rm -r` — Remove Folders (Directories)

**Purpose:**
`rm -r` deletes an entire folder (directory) and all its files.

**Syntax:**

```bash
rm -r foldername
```

**Example:**

```bash
rm -r old_project
```

**Explanation:**
This will delete the `old_project` folder and everything inside it. The `-r` means **recursive**, which tells the command to go inside the folder and delete everything.

---

### 10. `mv` — Move or Rename Files

**Purpose:**
`mv` can move a file to a different folder or rename it.

**Syntax:**

```bash
mv oldname newname
```

OR

```bash
mv filename folderpath
```

**Example 1 — Rename a file:**

```bash
mv report.txt report_old.txt
```

This changes the file name from `report.txt` to `report_old.txt`.

**Example 2 — Move a file:**

```bash
mv report.txt backup/
```

This moves `report.txt` into the `backup` folder.

---

### 11. `cp` — Copy Files

**Purpose:**
`cp` makes a copy of a file.

**Syntax:**

```bash
cp source destination
```

**Example:**

```bash
cp notes.txt notes_backup.txt
```

**Explanation:**
This makes a duplicate of `notes.txt` and names it `notes_backup.txt`. The original file stays unchanged.

---

### 12. `cp -r` — Copy Folders

**Purpose:**
`cp -r` copies an entire folder (and everything inside it).

**Syntax:**

```bash
cp -r source_folder destination_folder
```

**Example:**

```bash
cp -r project project_backup
```

**Explanation:**
This creates a copy of the `project` folder and names it `project_backup`. The `-r` flag ensures the command goes inside the folder and copies everything.

---

### 13. `cat` — View File Contents

**Purpose:**
`cat` shows the contents of a file directly in the terminal.

**Syntax:**

```bash
cat filename
```

**Example:**

```bash
cat README.md
```

**Explanation:**
This displays the text inside `README.md` without opening any editor.

---

### 14. `nano` — Edit Files in Terminal

**Purpose:**
`nano` opens a simple text editor inside the terminal.

**Syntax:**

```bash
nano filename
```

**Example:**

```bash
nano notes.txt
```

**Explanation:**
This opens `notes.txt` so you can edit it. Use arrow keys to move, type to add text, and press `CTRL + O` to save, `CTRL + X` to exit.

---

### 15. `man` — View Manual Pages

**Purpose:**
`man` shows the official manual for a command.

**Syntax:**

```bash
man commandname
```

**Example:**

```bash
man ls
```

**Explanation:**
This opens the manual for the `ls` command, explaining all its options. Use `q` to quit the manual.

---

### 16. `clear` — Clear the Terminal Screen

**Purpose:**
`clear` cleans up your terminal so you can work without clutter.

**Syntax:**

```bash
clear
```

**Example:**

```bash
clear
```

**Explanation:**
After running this, all previous commands disappear from view (but they’re still in history if you press the Up arrow).

---

### 17. `history` — See Command History

**Purpose:**
`history` shows all the commands you’ve run recently.

**Syntax:**

```bash
history
```

**Example:**

```bash
history
```
