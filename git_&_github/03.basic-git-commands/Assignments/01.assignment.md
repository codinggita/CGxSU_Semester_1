# **Git & GitHub Assignment – Mode 1: The Basic Cycle**

## **Objective**

Understand and practice the most common Git workflow:

1. Connect local repository to GitHub
2. Add changes
3. Commit them
4. Push to GitHub
5. Pull updates from GitHub

---

## **Step 1 – Create and Connect a Repository**

**Explanation:**
We need a local repo to store files and a GitHub repo to store them online.

**Steps:**

1. **On your computer**

   * Create a folder named `git-mode1`.
   * Open terminal in that folder and run:

     ```bash
     git init
     ```
2. **On GitHub**

   * Create a new repository named `git-mode1` (leave it empty).
3. **Connect local repo to GitHub**

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/git-mode1.git
   git branch -M main
   ```

---

## **Step 2 – Add and Commit a File**

**Explanation:**
Git works in two steps — staging (`git add`) and committing (`git commit`).

**Steps:**

1. Create a file `hello.txt` with:

   ```
   Hello Git and GitHub!
   ```
2. Stage the file:

   ```bash
   git add hello.txt
   ```
3. Commit the file:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "First commit: Add hello file"
   ```

---

## **Step 3 – Push Changes to GitHub**

**Explanation:**
Pushing sends local commits to the remote repository.

**Steps:**

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Now check your GitHub repository — the file should be there.

## **Step 4 – Make a Change and Push Again**

**Steps:**

1. Edit `hello.txt` to:

   ```
   Hello Git and GitHub!
   This is my second update.
   ```
2. Stage and commit:

   ```bash
   git add hello.txt
   git commit -m "Update hello file with second line"
   ```
3. Push to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

---

## **Step 5 – Pull Changes from GitHub**

**Explanation:**
Pulling gets updates from GitHub into your local machine.

**Steps:**

1. Go to GitHub, edit `hello.txt` directly in the browser, and add:

   ```
   This is an update from GitHub.
   ```
2. Save changes.
3. Back on your computer:

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```
