# **Git & GitHub + System Commands: Intermediate Assignment**

---

### **Stage 1: Git & GitHub Basics – Simple Push-Pull Cycle**

**Goal:** Learn to connect local Git with GitHub and perform basic add → commit → push → pull operations.

**Assignments:**

1. Install Git on your system and check version using:

   ```bash
   git --version
   ```
2. Configure your Git username and email.
3. Create a new folder for your project and initialize it as a Git repository.
4. Create a simple `README.md` file and write a short introduction.
5. Stage the file, commit it, and push to a new GitHub repository.
6. Make changes to `README.md`, commit, and push again.
7. Clone an existing GitHub repository to your local machine.
8. Make a small edit in the cloned repo, commit, and push.
9. Simulate a pull request by editing the file directly on GitHub, then use `git pull` locally to get the changes.

### **Stage 2: System Commands for Git Workflow**

**Goal:** Learn basic system commands to manage files, permissions, and directories during Git projects.

**Assignments:**

1. Use `pwd` to find your current working directory.
2. Use `ls` to list files in your Git project folder.
3. Create a new folder for Git work using `mkdir`.
4. Navigate into that folder using `cd`.
5. Create an empty file using `touch`.
6. Create a file with text using `echo` and redirect output (`>`).
7. View file contents with `cat`.
8. Change file permissions with `chmod` and observe changes.
9. Delete a file using `rm`.
10. Create and delete folders using `mkdir` and `rmdir`.
11. Rename/move files using `mv`.
12. Copy files using `cp`.
13. Use `man` or `--help` to explore command documentation.
14. Use `clear` to clean your terminal screen.
15. Use `history` to review previously run commands.

### **Stage 3: Combining Git & System Commands**

**Goal:** Use Git workflow along with system commands in real project tasks.

**Assignments:**

1. Create a folder for a project using `mkdir`, navigate into it, and initialize it with `git init`.
2. Create two new files using `touch`, add content using `echo`, and verify with `cat`.
3. Stage and commit both files to Git.
4. Change file permissions using `chmod` before committing.
5. Rename a file with `mv` and commit the change to Git.
6. Delete a file using `rm` and commit the deletion.
7. Clone a GitHub repository, list its contents with `ls`, and view a file using `cat`.
8. Use `git log` to see commit history, then try `history` to see terminal command history.
